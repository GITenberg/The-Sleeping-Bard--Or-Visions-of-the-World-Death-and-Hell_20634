<h2><!-- page iii--><a name="pageiii"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. iii</span>Preface.</h2>
<p>The Sleeping Bard was originally written in the Welsh 
language, and was published about the year 1720.&nbsp; The author
of it, Elis Wyn, was a clergyman of the Cambro Anglican Church, 
and a native of Denbighshire, in which county he passed the 
greater part of his life, at a place called Y las Ynys.&nbsp; 
Besides the Sleeping Bard, he wrote and published a book in 
Welsh, consisting of advice to Christian Professors.&nbsp; The 
above scanty details comprise all that is known of Elis 
Wyn.&nbsp; Both his works have enjoyed, and still enjoy, 
considerable popularity in Wales.</p>
<p>The Sleeping Bard, though a highly remarkable, is not exactly 
entitled to the appellation of an original work.&nbsp; There are 
in the Spanish language certain pieces by Francisco Quevedo, 
called &ldquo;Visions or Discourses;&rdquo; the principal ones 
<!-- page iv--><a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
iv</span>being &ldquo;The Vision of the Carcases, the Sties of 
Pluto, and the Inside of the World Disclosed; The Visit of the 
Gayeties, and the Intermeddler, the Duenna and the 
Informer.&rdquo;&nbsp; With all these the Visions of Elis Wyn 
have more or less connection.&nbsp; The idea of the Vision of the
World, was clearly taken from the Interior of the World 
Disclosed; the idea of the Vision of Death, from the Vision of 
the Carcases; that of the Vision of Hell, from the Sties of 
Pluto; whilst many characters and scenes in the three parts, into
which the work of Elis Wyn is divided, are taken either from the 
Visit of the Gayeties, the Intermeddler, or others of 
Quevedo&rsquo;s Visions; for example Rhywun, or Somebody, who in 
the Vision of Death makes the humorous complaint, that so much of
the villainy and scandal of the world is attributed to him, is 
neither more nor less than Quevedo&rsquo;s Juan de la Encina, or 
Jack o&rsquo; the Oak, who in the Visit of the Gayeties, is made 
to speak somewhat after the following fashion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O ye living people, spawn of Satan that ye 
are! what is the reason that ye cannot let me be at rest now that
I am dead, and all is over with me?&nbsp; What have I done to 
you?&nbsp; What have I done to cause you to defame me in every 
thing, who have a hand in nothing, and to blame me for that of 
which I am entirely ignorant?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are 
you?&rdquo; said I with a timorous bow, &ldquo;for I really do 
not understand you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;the unfortunate Juan de la Encina, whom, <!-- page v--><a 
name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>notwithstanding
I have been here many years, ye mix up with all the follies which
ye do and say during your lives; for all your lives long, 
whenever you hear of an absurdity, or commit one, you are in the 
habit of saying, &lsquo;Juan de la Encina could not have acted 
more like a fool;&rsquo; or, &lsquo;that is one of the follies of
Juan de la Encina.&rsquo;&nbsp; I would have you know that all 
you men, when you say or do foolish things, are Juan de la 
Encina; for this appellation of Encina, seems wide enough to 
cover all the absurdities of the world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, though there is a considerable amount of what is
Quevedo&rsquo;s in the Visions of Elis Wyn, there is a vast deal 
in them which strictly belongs to the Welshman.&nbsp; Upon the 
whole, the Cambrian work is superior to the Spanish.&nbsp; There 
is more unity of purpose in it, and it is far less encumbered 
with useless matter.&nbsp; In reading Quevedo&rsquo;s Visions, it
is frequently difficult to guess what the writer is aiming at; 
not so whilst perusing those of Elis Wyn.&nbsp; It is always 
clear enough, that the Welshman is either lashing the follies or 
vices of the world, showing the certainty of death, or 
endeavouring to keep people from Hell, by conveying to them an 
idea of the torments to which the guilty are subjected in a 
future state.</p>
<p>Whether Elis Wyn had ever read the Visions of Quevedo in their
original language, it is impossible to say; the probability 
however is, that he was acquainted with them <!-- page vi--><a 
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>through the 
medium of an English translation, which was published in London 
about the beginning of the eighteenth century; of the merits of 
that translation the present writer can say nothing, as it has 
never come to his hand: he cannot however help observing, that a 
person who would translate the Visions of Quevedo, and certain 
other writings of his, should be something more than a fair 
Spanish scholar, and a good master of the language into which he 
would render them, as they abound not only with idiomatic 
phrases, but terms of cant or German&iacute;a, which are as 
unintelligible as Greek or Arabic to the greater part of the 
Spaniards themselves.</p>
<p>The following translation of the Sleeping Bard has long 
existed in manuscript.&nbsp; It was made by the writer of these 
lines in the year 1830, at the request of a little Welsh 
bookseller of his acquaintance, who resided in the rather 
unfashionable neighbourhood of Smithfield, and who entertained an
opinion that a translation of the work of Elis Wyn, would enjoy a
great sale both in England and Wales.&nbsp; On the eve of 
committing it to the press however, the Cambrian Briton felt his 
small heart give way within him: &ldquo;Were I to print 
it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I should be ruined; the terrible 
descriptions of vice and torment, would frighten the genteel part
of the English public out of its wits, and I should to a 
certainty be prosecuted by Sir James Scarlett.&nbsp; I am much 
obliged to <!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>you, for the trouble you have given 
yourself on my account&mdash;but Myn Diawl!&nbsp; I had no idea 
till I had read him in English, that Elis Wyn had been such a 
terrible fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet there is no harm in the book.&nbsp; It is true that the 
Author is any thing but mincing in his expressions and 
descriptions, but there is nothing in the Sleeping Bard which can
give offence to any but the over fastidious.&nbsp; There is a 
great deal of squeamish nonsense in the world; let us hope 
however that there is not so much as there was.&nbsp; Indeed can 
we doubt that such folly is on the decline, when we find 
Albemarle Street in &rsquo;60, willing to publish a harmless but 
plain speaking book which Smithfield shrank from in 
&rsquo;30?</p>
<h2><!-- page 1--><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
1</span>The Vision of the Course of the World.</h2>
<p>One fine evening of warm sunny summer, I took a stroll to the 
top of one of the mountains of Wales, carrying with me a 
telescope to assist my feeble sight by bringing distant objects 
near, and magnifying small ones.&nbsp; Through the thin, clear 
air, and the calm and luminous heat, I saw many delightful 
prospects afar across the Irish sea.&nbsp; At length, after 
feasting my eyes on all the pleasant objects around me, until the
sun had reached his goal in the west, I lay down upon the green 
grass, reflecting, how fair and enchanting, from my own country, 
the countries appeared whose plains my eyes had glanced over, how
delightful it would be to obtain a full view of them, and how 
happy those were who saw the course of the world in comparison 
with me: weariness was the result of all this toiling with my 
eyes and my imagination, and in the shadow of Weariness, <i>Mr. 
Sleep</i> came stealthily to enthrall me, who with his keys of 
lead, locked the windows of my eyes, and all my other senses 
securely.&nbsp; But it was in vain for him to <!-- page 2--><a 
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>endeavour to 
lock up the soul, which can live and toil independently of the 
body, for my spirit escaped out of the locked body upon the wings
of Fancy, and the first thing which I saw by the side of me was a
dancing ring, and a kind of rabble in green petticoats and red 
caps dancing away with the most furious eagerness.&nbsp; I stood 
for a time in perplexity whether I should go to them or not, 
because in my flurry I feared they were a gang of hungry gipsies,
and that they would do nothing less than slaughter me for their 
supper, and swallow me without salt: but after gazing upon them 
for some time, I could see that they were better and handsomer 
than the swarthy, lying Egyptian race.&nbsp; So I ventured to 
approach them, but very softly, like a hen treading upon hot 
embers, that I might learn who they were; and at length I took 
the liberty of addressing them in this guise, with my head and 
back lowered horizontally: &ldquo;Fair assembly, as I perceive 
that you are gentry from distant parts, will you deign to take a 
Bard along with you, who is desirous of travelling?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
At these words the hurly-burly was hushed, and all fixed their 
eyes upon me: &ldquo;<i>Bard</i>,&rdquo; squeaked 
one&mdash;&ldquo;<i>travel</i>,&rdquo; said 
another&mdash;&ldquo;<i>along with us</i>,&rdquo; said the 
third.&nbsp; By this time I saw some looking particularly fierce 
upon me; then they began to whisper in each others ears certain 
secret words, and to look at me; at length the whispering ceased,
and each laying his gripe upon me they raised me upon their 
shoulders, as we do a knight of the shire, and then away with me 
they flew like the wind, over houses and fields, cities and 
kingdoms, seas and mountains; and so quickly did they fly that I 
could fasten my sight upon nothing, and what was worse, I began 
to suspect that my companions, by their frowning and knitting 
their brows at me, wanted me to sing blasphemy against my King 
and Maker.</p>
<p><!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
3</span>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I to myself, &ldquo;I may now 
bid farewell to life, these cursed witches will convey me to the 
pantry or cellar of some nobleman, and there leave me, to pay 
with my neck for their robberies; or they will abandon me stark 
naked, to freeze to death upon the sea-brink of old Shire Caer, 
<a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3" 
class="citation">[3]</a> or some other cold, distant 
place;&rdquo; but on reflecting that all the old hags whom I had 
once known had long been dead and buried, and perceiving that 
these people took pleasure in holding or waving me over hollow 
ravines, I conjectured that they were not witches but beings who 
are called fairies.&nbsp; We made no stop until I found myself by
the side of a huge castle, the most beautiful I had ever seen, 
with a large pool or moat surrounding it: then they began to 
consult what they should do with me; &ldquo;shall we go direct to
the castle with him?&rdquo; said one.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, let us 
hang him or cast him into the lake, he is not worth being shown 
to our great prince,&rdquo; said another.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did he say
his prayers before he went to sleep?&rdquo; said a third.&nbsp; 
At the mention of prayers, I uttered a confused groan to heaven 
for pardon and assistance; and as soon as I recollected myself, I
saw a light at a vast distance bursting forth, Oh, how 
glorious!&nbsp; As it drew nigh, my companions were darkening and
vanishing, and quickly there came floating towards us a form of 
light over the castle, whereupon the fairies abandoned their hold
of me, but as they departed they turned upon me a hellish scowl, 
and unless the angel had supported me, I should have been dashed 
into pieces small enough for a pasty, by the time I reached the 
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your business here?&rdquo; said the 
angel.&nbsp; &ldquo;In verity my lord,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I
do not know what place <i>here</i> is, nor what is my business, 
nor what I am myself, nor what has <!-- page 4--><a 
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>become of my 
other part; I had four limbs and a head, and whether I have left 
them at home, or whether the fairies, who have certainly not 
acted fairly with me, have cast me into some abyss, (for I 
remember to have passed over several horrid ravines,) I cannot 
tell, sir, though you should cause me to be hung.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Fairly indeed,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they would have 
acted with you, if I had not come just in time to save you from 
the clutches of these children of hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you have such a particular desire to see the 
course of the <i>little world</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have 
received commands to give you a sight of it, in order that you 
may see your error in being discontented with your station, and 
your own country.&nbsp; Come with me,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;for
a peregrination,&rdquo; and at the word he snatched me up, just 
as the dawn was beginning to break, far above the topmost tower 
of the castle; we rested in the firmament upon the ledge of a 
light cloud to gaze upon the rising sun; but my heavenly 
companion, was far more luminous than the sun, but all his 
splendour was upward, by reason of a veil which was betwixt him 
and the nether regions.&nbsp; When the light of the sun became 
stronger, I could see, between the two luminaries, the vast 
air-encircled world, like a little round bullet, very far beneath
us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look now,&rdquo; said the angel, giving me a 
different telescope from that which I had on the mountain.&nbsp; 
When I peeped through this I saw things in a manner altogether 
different from that in which I had seen them before, and in a 
much clearer one.&nbsp; I saw a city of monstrous size, and 
thousands of cities and kingdoms within it; and the great ocean, 
like a moat, around it, and other seas, like rivers, intersecting
it.</p>
<p>By dint of long gazing I could see that it was divided into 
three exceedingly large streets; each street with a large, <!-- 
page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
5</span>magnificent gate at the bottom, and each gate with a fair
tower over it.&nbsp; Upon each tower there was a damsel of 
wonderful beauty, standing in the sight of the whole street; and 
the three towers appeared to reach up behind the walls to the 
skirts of the castle afore-mentioned.&nbsp; Crossing these three 
huge streets I could see another; it was but little and mean in 
comparison with them, but it was clean and neat, and on a higher 
foundation than the other streets, proceeding upward towards the 
east, whilst the three others ran downward towards the north to 
the great gates.&nbsp; I now ventured to enquire of my companion 
whether I might be permitted to speak.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the angel, &ldquo;speak out! but 
listen attentively to my answers, so that I may not have to say 
the same thing to you more than once.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will,
my lord,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now pray, what place is the 
castle yonder in the north?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The castle above 
in the air,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;belongs to Belial, prince of 
the power of the air, and governor of all the great city below: 
it is called Delusive Castle, for Belial is a great deluder, and 
by his wiles he keeps under his banner all you see, with the 
exception of the little street yonder.&nbsp; He is a great 
prince, with thousands of princes under him&mdash;what were 
C&aelig;sar or Alexander the Great compared with him?&nbsp; What 
are the Turk and old Lewis of France, but his servants?&nbsp; 
Great, yea, exceeding great, are the power, subtlety, and 
diligence of the prince Belial; and his armies in the country 
below are innumerable.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For what 
purpose,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are the damsels standing yonder, 
and who are they?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Softly,&rdquo; said the 
angel, &ldquo;one question at once: they are there to be loved 
and to be adored.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And no wonder 
indeed,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;since they are so amiable; if I 
possessed feet and hands as formerly, I would go and offer love 
and adoration to them myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hush, <!-- page
6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
6</span>hush,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you would do so with your
members, it is well that you are without them; know, thou foolish
spirit, that these three princesses are only three destructive 
deluders, daughters of the prince Belial, and all their beauty 
and affability, which are irradiating the streets, are only masks
over deformity and cruelty; the three within are like their 
father, replete with deadly poison.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Woe&rsquo;s me; is it possible,&rdquo; said I, quite sad, 
and smitten with love of them!&nbsp; &ldquo;It is but too true, 
alas,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou admirest the radiance 
with which they shine upon their adorers; but know that there is 
in that radiance a very wondrous charm; it blinds men from 
looking back, it deafens them lest they should hear their danger,
and it burns them with ceaseless longing for more of it; which 
longing, is itself a deadly poison, breeding, within those who 
feel it, diseases not to be got rid of, which no physician can 
cure, not even death, nor anything, unless the heavenly medicine,
which is called repentance, is procured, to cast out the evil in 
time, before it is imbibed too far, by excessive looking upon 
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But how is it,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;that Belial does not wish to have these adorers 
himself?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He has them,&rdquo; said the angel; 
&ldquo;the old fox is adored in his daughters, because, whilst a 
man sticks to these, or to one of the three, he is securely under
the mark of Belial, and wears his livery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the names,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;of those 
three deceivers?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The farthest, yonder,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;is called <i>Pride</i>, the eldest daughter of 
Belial; the second is <i>Pleasure</i>; and <i>Lucre</i> is the 
next to us: these three are the trinity which the world 
adores.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, has this great, distracted 
city,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;any better name than <i>Bedlam the 
Great</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It has,&rdquo; he replied, 
&ldquo;it is called <i>The City of Perdition</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Woe is me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are all <!-- page 7--><a 
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>that are 
contained therein people of perdition?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The 
whole,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;except some who may escape out to 
the most high city above, ruled by the king 
Emmanuel.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Woe&rsquo;s me and mine,&rdquo; 
said I, &ldquo;how shall they escape, ever gazing, as they are, 
upon the thing which blinds them more and more, and which 
plunders them in their blindness?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be
quite impossible,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for one man to escape 
from thence, did not Emmanuel send his messengers, early and 
late, from above, to persuade them to turn to him, their lawful 
King, from the service of the rebel, and also transmit to some, 
the present of a precious ointment, called <i>faith</i>, to 
anoint their eyes with; and whosoever obtains this <i>true</i> 
ointment, (for there is a counterfeit of it, as there is of every
thing else, in the city of Perdition,) and anoints himself with 
it, will see his wounds, and his madness, and will not tarry a 
minute longer here, though Belial should give him his three 
daughters, yea, or the fourth, which is the greatest of all, to 
do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are those great streets called?&rdquo; said 
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Each is called,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;by the 
name of the princess who governs it: the first is the street of 
<i>Pride</i>, the middle one the street of <i>Pleasure</i>, and 
the nearest, the street of <i>Lucre</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray
tell me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;who are dwelling in these 
streets?&nbsp; What is the language which they speak?&nbsp; What 
are the tenets which they hold; and to what nation do they 
belong?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Many,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of every
language, faith, and nation under the Sun, are living in each of 
those vast streets below; and there are many living in each of 
the three streets alternately, and every one as near as possible 
to the gate; and they frequently remove, unable to tarry long in 
the one, from the great love they bear to the princess of some 
other street; and the old fox looks slyly on, permitting every 
one to love his choice, or <!-- page 8--><a 
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>all three if he
pleases, for then he is most sure of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come nearer to them,&rdquo; said the angel, and hurried
with me downwards, shrouded in his impenetrable veil, through 
much noxious vapour which was rising from the city; presently we 
descended in the street of Pride, upon a spacious mansion open at
the top, whose windows had been dashed out by dogs and crows, and
whose owners had departed to England or France, to seek there for
what they could have obtained much easier at home; thus, instead 
of the good, old, charitable, domestic family of yore, there were
none at present but owls, crows, or chequered magpies, whose 
hooting, cawing and chattering were excellent comments on the 
practices of the present owners.&nbsp; There were in that street,
myriads of such abandoned palaces, which might have been, had it 
not been for Pride, the resorts of the best, as of yore, places 
of refuge for the weak, schools of peace and of every kind of 
goodness; and blessings to thousands of small houses around.</p>
<p>From the summit of this ruin, we had scope and leisure enough 
to observe the whole street on either side.&nbsp; There were fair
houses of wondrous height and magnificence&mdash;and no wonder, 
as there were emperors, kings, and hundreds of princes there, and
thousands of nobles and gentry, and very many women of every 
degree.&nbsp; I saw a vain high-topt creature, like a ship at 
full sail, walking as if in a frame, carrying about her full the 
amount of a pedlar&rsquo;s pack, and having at her ears, the 
worth of a good farm, in pearls; and there were not a few of her 
kind&mdash;some were singing, in order that their voices might be
praised; some were dancing, to show their figures; others were 
painting to improve their complexions; others had been trimming 
themselves before the glass, for three hours, learning to smile, 
moving pins and making gestures and putting <!-- page 9--><a 
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>themselves in 
attitudes.&nbsp; There was many a vain creature there, who did 
not know how to open her lips to speak, or to eat, nor, from 
sheer pride, to look under her feet; and many a ragged shrew, who
would insist that she was as good a gentlewoman as the best in 
the street; and many an ambling fop, who could winnow beans with 
the mere wind of his train.</p>
<p>Whilst I was looking, from afar upon these, and a hundred 
such, behold! there passed by towards us, a bouncing, variegated 
lady with a lofty look, and with a hundred folks gazing after 
her; some bent themselves as if to adore her; some few thrust 
something into her hand.&nbsp; Being unable to imagine who she 
was, I enquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied my friend, 
&ldquo;she is one who has all her portion in sight, yet you see 
how many foolish people are seeking her, and the meanest of them 
in possession of all the attainments she can boast of.&nbsp; 
<i>She will not have what she can gain</i>, <i>and will never 
gain what she desires</i>, and she will speak to no one but her 
betters, on account of her mother&rsquo;s telling her, 
&lsquo;that a young woman cannot do a worse thing, than be humble
in her love.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon came out from beneath 
us a pillar of a man, who had been an alderman, and in many 
official situations; he came spreading his wings as if to fly, 
though he could scarcely draw one knee after the other, on 
account of the gout, and various other genteel disorders: 
notwithstanding which, you could not obtain from him, but through
a very great favour, a glance or a nod, though you should call 
him by his titles and his offices.</p>
<p>From this being I turned my eyes to the other side of the 
street, where I beheld a lusty young nobleman, with a number of 
people behind him; he had a sweet smile and a condescending air 
to every one who met him.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;that this young man and yonder personage <!-- page 
10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
10</span>should belong to the same street.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Oh, the same princess Pride rules them both,&rdquo; 
answered the angel,&mdash;&ldquo;this young man is only speaking 
fair on account of the errand he comes upon; he is seeking 
popularity at present, with the intent to raise himself thereby 
to the highest office in the kingdom&mdash;it is easy for him to 
lament to the people how much they are wronged by the oppression 
of bad masters; but his own exaltment, and not the weal of the 
kingdom, is the heart of the matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; After gazing 
for a long time, I perceived at the gate of Pride, a fair city 
upon seven hills, and on the top of its lofty palace there was a 
triple crown, with swords and keys crossed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lo! 
there is Rome,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and therein dwells the 
Pope.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, most usually,&rdquo; said the 
angel; &ldquo;but he has a palace in each of the other 
streets.&rdquo;&nbsp; Over against Rome, I could see a city with 
an exceedingly fair palace, and upon it was mounted on high, a 
half-moon on a banner of gold, and by that I knew that the Turk 
was there.&nbsp; Next to the gate after those, was the palace of 
Lewis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span>, of France, as I understood
by his arms, three fleurs-de-lis upon a silver banner hanging 
aloft.&nbsp; Whilst looking on the height and majesty of these 
palaces, I perceived that there was much passing and repassing 
from the one to the other, and I asked what was the cause 
thereof?&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, there is many a dark cause,&rdquo; said
the angel, &ldquo;why those three crafty, powerful heads should 
communicate; but though they account themselves fully adapted to 
espouse the three princesses above, their power and subtlety are 
nothing when compared with these; yes, Belial the Great does not 
esteem the whole city, (though so numerous be its kings), as 
equivalent to his daughters.&nbsp; Notwithstanding that he offers
them in marriage to everybody, he has still never given one 
entirely to anybody yet.&nbsp; There <!-- page 11--><a 
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>has been a 
rivalry between these three concerning them:&mdash;the Turk, who 
calls himself <i>God upon earth</i>, wished for the eldest, 
Pride, in marriage.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the king of 
France, &lsquo;she belongs to me, as I keep all my subjects in 
her street, and likewise bring many to her from England and other
countries.&rsquo;&nbsp; Spain would have the princess Lucre, in 
despite of Holland and all the Jews.&nbsp; England would have the
princess Pleasure, in despite of the Pagans.&nbsp; But the Pope 
would have the whole three, and with better reason than all the 
rest together, therefore Belial has stationed him next to them in
the three streets.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And is it on this account 
that there is this intercourse at present,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No;&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;Belial has arranged the 
matter between them for some time; but at present he has caused 
them to lay their heads together, how they may best destroy the 
cross street yonder, which is the city of Emmanuel, and 
particularly one great palace which is there, out of sheer venom 
at perceiving that it is a fairer edifice than exists in all the 
city of Perdition.&nbsp; Belial moreover has promised to those 
who shall accomplish its destruction, the half of his kingdom 
during his life, and the whole when he is dead.&nbsp; But, 
notwithstanding the greatness of his power and the depth of his 
wiles; notwithstanding the multitude of crafty emperors, kings, 
and rulers, who are beneath his banner in the vast city of 
Perdition; and notwithstanding the bravery of his countless 
legions on the outer side of the gates in the world below; 
notwithstanding all this,&rdquo; said the angel, &ldquo;he shall 
see that it is a task above his power to perform.&nbsp; Yes; 
however great Belial may be, he shall find that there is One 
greater than he, in the little street yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was unable to hear his angelic reasons completely, from the 
tumbling there was along this slippery street every hour, <!-- 
page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
12</span>and I could see some people with ladders scaling the 
tower, and having reached the highest step fall headlong to the 
bottom.&nbsp; &ldquo;To what place are those fools seeking to 
get?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;To a place high enough,&rdquo; 
said he; &ldquo;they are seeking to break into the treasury of 
the princess.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will warrant it is full 
enough,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he replied; 
&ldquo;and with every thing which belongs to this street, for the
purpose of being distributed amongst the inhabitants.&nbsp; There
you will find every species of warlike arms to subdue and to 
over-run countries; every species of arms of gentility, banners, 
escutcheons, books of pedigree, stanzas and poems relating to 
ancestry, with every species of brave garments; admirable 
stories, lying portraits; all kinds of tints and waters to 
embellish the countenance; all sorts of high offices and titles; 
and, to be brief, there is every thing there that is adapted to 
cause a man to think better of himself, and worse of others than 
he ought.&nbsp; The chief officers of this treasury are masters 
of ceremonies, vagabonds, genealogists, bards, orators, 
flatterers, dancers, tailors, mantua-makers, and the 
like.&rdquo;&nbsp; From this great street we proceeded to the 
next, where the princess Lucre reigns; it was a full and 
prodigiously wealthy street, yet not half so splendid and clean 
as the street of Pride, nor its people half so bold and lofty 
looking; for they were skulking mean-looking fellows, for the 
most part.</p>
<p>There were in this street thousands of Spaniards, Hollanders, 
Venetians, and Jews, and a great many aged, decrepit people were 
also there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what 
kind of men are these?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They have all gain in 
view,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;At the lowest extremity, on 
one side, you will still see the Pope; also subduers of kingdoms 
and their soldiers, oppressors, foresters, shutters up of the 
common foot-paths, <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>justices and their bribers, and the 
whole race of lawyers down to the catchpole.&nbsp; On the other 
side,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there are physicians, apothecaries, 
doctors, misers, merchants, extortioners, usurers, refusers to 
pay tithes, wages, rents, or alms which were left to schools and 
charity houses; purveyors and chapmen who keep and raise the 
market to their own price; shopkeepers (or sharpers) who make 
money out of the necessity or ignorance of the buyer; stewards of
every degree, sturdy beggars, taverners who plunder the families 
of careless men of their property, and the country of its barley 
for the bread of the poor.&nbsp; All these are thieves of the 
first water,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and the rest are petty 
thieves, for the most part, and keep at the upper end of the 
street; they consist of highway robbers, tailors, weavers, 
millers, measurers of wet and dry, and the like.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 
the midst of this discourse, I heard a prodigious tumult at the 
lower end of the street, where there was a huge crowd of people 
thronging towards the gate, with such pushing and disputing as 
caused me to imagine that there was a general fray on foot, until
I demanded of my friend what was the matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;There 
is an exceeding great treasure in that tower,&rdquo; said the 
angel, &ldquo;and all that concourse is for the purpose of 
choosing a treasurer to the princess, in lieu of the Pope, who 
has been turned out of that office.&rdquo;&nbsp; So we went to 
see the election.</p>
<p>The men who were competing for the office were the 
<i>Stewards</i>, the <i>Usurers</i>, the <i>Lawyers</i>, and the 
<i>Merchants</i>, and the richest of the whole was to obtain it, 
because the more you have the more you shall crave, is the 
epidemic curse of the street.&nbsp; The Stewards were rejected at
the first offer, lest they should impoverish the whole street, 
and, as they had raised their palaces on the ruins of their 
masters, lest they <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>should in the end turn the princess 
out of her possession; then the dispute arose between the three 
others; the Merchants had the most silks, the Lawyers most 
mortgages on lands, and the Usurers the greatest number of full 
bags, and bills and bonds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha! they will not agree 
to night,&rdquo; said the angel, &ldquo;so come away; the Lawyers
are richer than the Merchants, the Usurers are richer than the 
Lawyers, and the Stewards than the Usurers, and Belial than the 
whole, for he owns them all, and their property too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what reason is the princess keeping these thieves 
about her?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;What can be more 
proper,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when she herself is the arrantest 
of thieves.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was astonished to hear him call the 
princess thus, and the greatest potentates thieves of the first 
water.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, my lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how can 
you call those illustrious people greater thieves than robbers on
the highway?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are but a dupe,&rdquo; said 
he; &ldquo;is not the villain who goes over the world with his 
sword in his hand and his plunderers behind him, burning and 
slaying, wresting kingdoms from their right owners, and looking 
forward to be adored as a conqueror, worse than the rogue who 
takes a purse upon the highway?&nbsp; What is the tailor who 
cabbages a piece of cloth, to the great man who takes a piece out
of the parish common?&nbsp; Ought not the latter to be called a 
thief of the first water, or ten times more a rogue than the 
other?&mdash;the tailor merely takes snips of cloth from his 
customer, whilst the other takes from the poor man the sustenance
of his beast, and by so doing the sustenance of himself and his 
little ones&mdash;what is taking a handful of flour at the mill, 
to keeping a hundred sacksfull to putrify, in order to obtain 
afterwards a four-fold price?&mdash;what is the half-naked 
soldier who takes <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>your garment away with his sword, to 
the lawyer, who takes your whole estate from you with a 
goose&rsquo;s quill, without any claim or bond upon it?&mdash;and
what is the pickpocket who takes five pounds, to the cogger of 
dice who will cheat you of a hundred in the third part of a 
night?&mdash;and what is the jockey who tricks you in some old 
unsound horse, to the apothecary who chouses you of your money, 
and your life also with some old unwholesome physic?&mdash;and 
yet what are all these thieves to the mistress-thief there, who 
takes away from the whole all these things, and their hearts and 
their souls at the end of the fair?&rdquo;&nbsp; From this dirty,
disorderly street we proceeded to the street of the princess 
Pleasure, in which I beheld a number of Britons, French, 
Italians, Pagans, &amp;c.&nbsp; She was a princess exceedingly 
beautiful to the eye, with a cup of drugged wine in the one hand,
and a crown and a harp in the other.&nbsp; In her treasury there 
were numberless pleasures and pretty things to obtain the custom 
of every body, and to keep them in the service of her 
father.&nbsp; Yea! there were many who escaped to this charming 
street, to cast off the melancholy arising from their losses and 
debts in the other streets.&nbsp; It was a street prodigiously 
crowded, especially with young people; and the princess was 
careful to please every body, and to keep an arrow adapted to 
every mark.&nbsp; If you are thirsty, you can have here your 
choice of drink; if you love dancing and singing, you can get 
here your fill.&nbsp; If her comeliness entice you to lust for 
the body of a female, she has only to lift up her finger to one 
of the officers of her father, (who surround her at all times, 
though invisibly), and they will fetch you a lass in a minute, or
the <i>body</i> of a harlot newly buried, and will go into her in
lieu of a <i>soul</i>, rather than you should abandon so good a 
design.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
16</span>Here there are handsome houses with very pleasant 
gardens, teeming orchards, and shadowy groves, adapted to all 
kinds of secret meetings, in which one can hunt birds and a 
certain fair coney; here there are delightful rivers for fishing,
and wide fields hedged around, in which it is pleasant to hunt 
the hare and fox.&nbsp; All along the street you could see farces
being acted, juggling going on, and all kinds of tricks of 
legerdemain; there was plenty of licentious music, vocal and 
instrumental, ballad singing, and every species of merriment; 
there was no lack of male and female beauty, singing and dancing;
and there were here many from the street of Pride, who came to 
receive praise and adoration.&nbsp; In the interior of the houses
I could see people on beds of silk and down, wallowing in 
voluptuousness; some were engaged at billiard-playing, and were 
occasionally swearing or cursing the table keeper; others were 
rattling the dice or shuffling the cards.&nbsp; My guide pointed 
out to me some from the street of Lucre, who had chambers in this
street; they had run hither to reckon their money, but they did 
not tarry long lest some of the innumerable tempting things to be
met with here should induce them to part with their pelf, without
usury.&nbsp; I could see throngs of individuals feasting, with 
something of every creature before them; oh, how every one did 
gorge, swallowing mess after mess of dainties, sufficient to have
feasted a moderate man for three weeks, and when they could eat 
no more, they belched out a thanks for what they had received, 
and then gave the health of the king and every jolly companion; 
after which, they drowned the savour of the food, and their cares
besides, in an ocean of wine; then they called for tobacco, and 
began telling stories of their neighbours&mdash;and, I observed, 
that all the stories were well received, whether true <!-- page 
17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>or 
false, provided they were amusing and of late date, above all if 
they contained plenty of scandal: there they sat, each with his 
clay pistol puffing forth fire and smoke, and slander to his 
neighbour.&nbsp; At length I was fain to request my guide to 
permit me to move on; the floor was impure with saliva and spilt 
drink, and I was apprehensive that certain heavy hiccups which I 
heard, might be merely the prelude to something more 
disagreeable.</p>
<p>From thence we went to a place where we heard a terrible 
noise, a medley of striking, jabbering, crying and laughing, 
shouting and singing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Bedlam, 
doubtless,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; By the time we entered the den 
the brawling had ceased.&nbsp; Of the company, one was on the 
ground insensible; another was in a yet more deplorable 
condition; another was nodding over a hearthful of battered pots,
pieces of pipes, and oozings of ale.&nbsp; And what was all this,
upon enquiry, but a carousal of seven thirsty neighbours&mdash;a 
goldsmith, a pilot, a smith, a miner, a chimney-sweeper, a poet, 
and a parson who had come to preach sobriety, and to exhibit in 
himself what a disgusting thing drunkenness is.&nbsp; The origin 
of the last squabble was a dispute which had arisen among them, 
about which of the seven loved a pipe and flagon best.&nbsp; The 
poet had carried the day over all the rest, with the exception of
the parson, who, out of respect for his cloth, had the most 
votes, being placed at the head of the jolly companions&mdash;the
poet singing:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, where are there seven beneath the 
sky,<br />
Who with these seven for thirst can vie?<br />
But the best for good ale, these seven among,<br />
Are the jolly divine, and the son of song.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Disgusted with these drunken swine, we went nearer to <!-- 
page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
18</span>the gate, to take a peep at the follies of the palace of
<i>Love</i>, the purblind king; it is a place easy to enter and 
difficult to escape from, and in it there is a prodigious number 
of chambers.&nbsp; In the hall opposite to the door was insane 
Cupid, with his two arrows upon his bow, shooting tormenting 
poison, which is called <i>bliss</i>.&nbsp; Upon the floor I 
could see many fair damsels, finely dressed, walking about, and 
behind them a parcel of miserable youths gazing upon their 
beauty, and each eager to obtain a glance from his mistress, 
fearing her frown far worse than death.&nbsp; One was bending to 
the ground and placing a letter in the hands of his goddess; 
another a piece of music, all in fearful expectation, like 
school-boys showing their tasks to their master; and the damsels 
would glance back upon them a smile, to keep up the fervour of 
their adorers, but nothing more, lest they should lose their 
desire, become cured of their wound and depart.&nbsp; On going 
forward to the parlour, I beheld females learning to dance and to
sing, and to play on instruments, for the purpose of making their
lovers seven times more foolish than they were already: on going 
to the buttery, I found them taking lessons in delicacy and 
propriety of eating: on going to the cellar, I saw them making up
potent love drinks, from nail-parings and the like: on going to 
the chambers, we beheld a fellow in a secret apartment, putting 
himself into all kinds of attitudes, to teach his beloved elegant
manners; another learning in a glass to laugh in a becoming 
manner, without showing to his love too much of his teeth; 
another we found embellishing his tale before going to her, and 
repeating the same lesson a hundred times.&nbsp; Tired of this 
insiped folly, I went to another chamber, where there was a 
nobleman, who had sent for a bard from the street of Pride, to 
compose a eulogistic strain on his angel, and a <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>laudatory ode
on himself; the bard was haranguing upon his 
talent&mdash;&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;compare her to 
all the red and white under the sun, and say that her hair is a 
hundredfold more yellow than gold; and as for your ode, I can 
carry your genealogy through the bowels of an infinity of knights
and princes, and through the waters of the deluge, even as high 
up as Adam.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lo!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;here is
a bard who is a better inventor than myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Come away, come away,&rdquo; said the angel, &ldquo;these 
people are thinking to bamboozle the woman, but when they go to 
her, they will be sure to obtain from her as good as they 
bring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On leaving these people, we caught a glimpse of some cells, 
where more obscene practices were going on than modesty will 
suffer me to mention, which caused my companion to snatch me away
in wrath, from this palace of whimsicality and wantonness, to the
treasury of the princess, (because we went where we pleased, in 
spite of doors and locks.)&nbsp; There we beheld a multitude of 
beautiful damsels, all sorts of drink, fruit, and dainties; all 
kinds of instruments and books of music, harps, pipes, poems, 
carols, &amp;c.; all kinds of games of chance, draught-boards, 
dice-boxes, dice, cards, &amp;c.; all kinds of models of banquets
and mansions, figures of men, contrivances and amusements; all 
kinds of waters, perfumes, colors and salves to make the ugly 
handsome, and the old look young, and to make the harlot and her 
putrid bones sweet for a time.</p>
<p>To be brief, there were here all kinds of <i>shadows</i> of 
pleasure, all kinds of <i>seeming</i> delight; and to tell the 
truth, I believe this place would have ensnared me, had not my 
friend, without ceremony, snatched me far away from the three 
deceitful towers, to the upper end of the street, and set me down
by a castellated palace of prodigious size, and very agreeable 
<!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
20</span>at first sight, but vile and terribly revolting on the 
farthest side, though it was only seen with great difficulty on 
the side of its deformity; it had a multitude of doors, and all 
the doors were splendid on the outside, but filthy within.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Pray, my lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if it please you, 
what is this wonderful place?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; 
said he, &ldquo;is the palace of another daughter of Belial, who 
is called <i>Hypocrisy</i>; she here keeps her school; there is 
not a youth or damsel within the whole city, that has not been 
her scholar, and the people in general, have so well imbibed what
she has taught, that her lessons have become a second nature, and
intertwined with all their thoughts, words and actions, almost 
since the time of their childhood.&rdquo;&nbsp; After I had 
inspected for a time the falsehood of every corner of the 
edifice, a procession passed by with a deal of weeping and 
groaning, and many men and horses dight in habits of deep 
mourning.&nbsp; Presently came a wretched widow, closely muffled,
in order that she might look no more on this vile world; she was 
feebly crying, and groaning slowly in the intervals of fainting 
fits&mdash;verily, I could not help weeping myself, out of 
pity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pooh, pooh,&rdquo; said the angel, &ldquo;keep
your tears for something more worthy; these faintings are only a 
lesson of Hypocrisy, and in her great school these black garments
were fashioned.&nbsp; There is not one of these people weeping 
seriously; the widow, before the body left the house, had wedded 
another man, in her heart; and if she could get rid of the 
expense attending the body, she would not care a rush if the soul
of her husband were at the bottom of hell; nor would her 
relations, more than herself; because when his disease was 
hardest upon him, instead of giving him salutary counsel and 
praying fervently, for the Lord to have mercy upon him, they only
talked to him about his effects, and about his testament, or his 
pedigree, <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>or what a handsome vigorous man he 
had been, and the like; so all this lamenting is mere 
sham&mdash;some are mourning in obedience to custom and habit, 
others for company&rsquo;s sake, and others for hire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had this procession passed by, when, lo, another 
crowd came in sight.&nbsp; A certain nobleman, prodigiously 
magnificient, and his lady at his side, were going along in 
state; many respectable men were capping them, and there were a 
thousand also behind them, shewing them every kind of submission 
and reverence, and by the <i>favours</i>, I perceived that it was
a wedding: &ldquo;He must be a very exalted nobleman,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;who merits so much respect from all these 
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If you should consider the whole, you
would say something quite different,&rdquo; said my guide; 
&ldquo;that nobleman is one from the street of Pleasure; and the 
female, is a damsel from the street of Pride, and the old man 
yonder, who is speaking with him, is one from the street of 
Lucre, who has lent money upon nearly all the land of the 
nobleman, and is to-day come to settle accounts.&rdquo;&nbsp; We 
drew nigh to hear the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, sir,&rdquo; says the usurer, &ldquo;I would not
for all I possess, that you should want any thing that I can 
offer, in order that you may appear to-day like yourself, 
especially since you have met with a lady so amiable and 
illustrious as this.&rdquo;&nbsp; (The subtle old dog knowing 
perfectly well what she was all the time.)&nbsp; &ldquo;By the 
Lord above,&rdquo; said the nobleman, &ldquo;the next greatest 
pleasure, to looking at her beauty, is to listen to your obliging
discourse; I would rather pay you usury than obtain money gratis 
from any one else.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Of a surety, my 
lord,&rdquo; said one of his principal associates, who was called
flatterer, &ldquo;my uncle shows you no respect but what is fully
your right; but with your permission, I will assert, that he <!--
page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
22</span>has not bestowed half the commendation on her ladyship 
which she deserves.&nbsp; I cannot myself produce, and I will 
defy any man to produce one lovelier than herself, in the whole 
street of Pride; nor one more gallant than you, my lord, in the 
whole street of Pleasure; nor one more courteous than you, dear 
uncle, in the whole street of Lucre.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, that
is only your good opinion,&rdquo; replied the lord, &ldquo;but I 
certainly believe that two never came together with more mutual 
love than we.&rdquo;&nbsp; As they proceeded, the crowd 
increased, and every one had a fair smile and a low bow for the 
other, and forward they ran to meet each other with their noses 
to the ground, like two cocks going to engage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Know 
now,&rdquo; said the angel, &ldquo;that you have not yet seen a 
<i>bow</i> here, nor heard a <i>word</i>, that did not belong to 
the lessons of Hypocrisy.&nbsp; There is not here one, after all 
this courtesy, that has a farthing&rsquo;s worth of love for the 
other; indeed they are for the most part enemies to one 
another.&nbsp; The nobleman here is only a butt amongst them, and
every one has his hit at him.&nbsp; The lady has her mind fixed 
upon his <i>grandeur</i> and his <i>nobility</i>, whereby she 
hopes to obtain precedence over many of her acquaintances.&nbsp; 
The miser has his eye upon his <i>land</i>, for his own son; and 
the others, to a man, on the money, which he is to receive as her
portion, because they are all his subjects, that is, his 
merchants, his tailors, his shoemakers, or his other tradesmen, 
who have arrayed him and maintained him in all this great 
splendour, without yet obtaining one farthing, nor any thing but 
fair words, and now and then, threats perhaps.&nbsp; Now observe 
how many masks, how many twists, Hypocrisy has given to the face 
of the truth?&nbsp; He is promising grandeur to his love, having 
already disposed of his land; and she is promising portion and 
purity, whereas she has no purity, <!-- page 23--><a 
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>but purity of
dress, and as for her portion it will not be long in existence, 
there being an inveterate cancer in it, even as there is in her 
own body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here is a proof,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that one 
never ought to judge by appearances.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but come away, and I will show
you something more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon he transported me up 
to where stood the churches of the city of Perdition, for every 
body in it had an appearance of faith, even in the age of 
Disbelief.&nbsp; First we went to the temple of Heathenism, where
I could see some adoring the form of a man, others that of the 
sun, others that of the moon, and an innumerable quantity of 
similar other gods, even down to leek and garlick, and a great 
goddess termed <i>Delusion</i>, obtaining general adoration, 
although you might see something of the remnants of the Christian
faith amongst some of these people.&nbsp; Thence we went to a 
meeting of Dummies, where there was nothing but groaning, and 
shivering, and beating the breast.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though there is 
here,&rdquo; said the angel, &ldquo;an appearance of repentance 
and great submission, there is nothing in reality, but 
opinionativeness and obstinacy, and pride, and thick, thick 
darkness.&nbsp; Notwithstanding they talk so much about their 
<i>internal light</i>, they have not even the spectacle-glasses 
of nature which the heathens have, whom you lately 
saw.&rdquo;&nbsp; From these dumb dogs we chanced to turn to a 
large church open at the top, with a prodigious number of sandals
<a name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23" 
class="citation">[23]</a> at the gate, by which I knew that it 
was the temple of the Turks; these people had only a dim and 
motley colored spectacle glass, which they called the Koran, yet 
through this they were always gazing up to the top of the church 
for their prophet, who, according to the promise <!-- page 
24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>which
he gave them, ought to have returned to them long ago, but has 
not yet made his appearance.&nbsp; From there we went to the 
church of the Jews, people who had failed to find the way of 
escape from the city of Perdition, although they possessed a 
pure, clear spectacle glass, on account of a film having come 
over their eyes from long gazing, for want of having anointed 
them with the precious ointment, <i>faith</i>.&nbsp; We next went
to that of the Papists.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said the 
angel, &ldquo;the church which <i>deceiveth the 
nations</i>!&nbsp; Hypocrisy has built this church at her own 
expense; for the Papists permit, yea enjoin the breaking of any 
oath made to a heretic, although it were taken upon the 
sacrament.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the chancel we passed through 
key-holes to the upper end of a cell which stood apart, full of 
burning candles at mid-day, where we perceived a priest with his 
crown shaven, walking about as if he were in expectation of 
visitors; presently there came a rotund figure of a woman, and a 
very pretty girl behind her, and they went upon their knees 
before him to confess their sins.&nbsp; &ldquo;My spiritual 
father,&rdquo; said the good woman, &ldquo;I labour under a 
burden too heavy to be borne, unless you in your mercy will 
lighten it; I married a member of the church of England, 
and&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What,&rdquo; said the shaven crown, 
&ldquo;married a heretic! married an enemy! there is no pardon 
for you, now or ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this word she fainted, and 
he vociferated curses at her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, and what is 
worse,&rdquo; said she when she revived.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have 
killed him!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O, ho! you have killed him, well 
that is something towards obtaining reconciliation with the 
church; but I assure you, that unless you had killed him, you 
would never have got absolution, nor purgatory, but would have 
gone plump to the devil.&nbsp; But where is your offering to the 
cloister?&rdquo; said he, snarling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she
replied, and <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>handed him a pretty big purse of 
money.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will now make 
your peace, and your penance is to remain a widow as long as you 
live, lest you should make another bad bargain.&rdquo;&nbsp; As 
soon as she had departed, the damsel came forward to make her 
confession.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your pardon, my father confessor,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;I have borne a child and murdered 
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very fair, in troth,&rdquo; said the 
confessor, &ldquo;and who was the father?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it was one of your 
monastery&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hush, hush,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;no scandal against the men of the church: but where is 
your atonement to the church?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There,&rdquo; 
said she, handing him a gold coin.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must repent, 
and your penance is to watch to night by my bedside,&rdquo; said 
he, smiling archly upon her.</p>
<p>At this moment appeared four other bald-pates, hauling in a 
lad to the confessor, the poor fellow looking as pleased as if he
were going to the gallows.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have brought you a 
cub,&rdquo; said one of the four, &ldquo;that you may award him a
proper punishment for revealing the secrets of the catholic 
church.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What secrets?&rdquo; said the 
confessor, looking towards a murky cell which was nigh at 
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;But confess villain, what did you 
say?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; said the wretch, 
&ldquo;one of my acquaintances asked me, if I had seen the 
<i>souls</i> shrieking beneath the altar, <i>on the day of the 
festival of the dead</i>?&nbsp; And I said, that I had heard the 
voice, but that I had seen nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, sir, 
say the whole,&rdquo; said one of the others.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I 
added,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I had heard that you were only
deceiving us ignorant people, and that instead of souls 
shrieking, there were only sea-crabs crackling beneath the 
carpet,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;O son of the fiend! blasphemous 
monster!&rdquo; said the confessor; &ldquo;but proceed 
caitiff.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;and that it was a wire which turned 
the image of saint Peter,&rdquo; said the fellow, &ldquo;and <!--
page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
26</span>that it was by the wire that the Holy Ghost descended 
from the gallery of the cross upon the priest.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;O heritage of hell!&rdquo; said the confessor.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;So ho here! take him torturers, and cast him into the 
smoky chimney yonder for telling tales.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here 
you see,&rdquo; said the angel, &ldquo;the church which Hypocrisy
desires should be called the Catholic Church, and the members of 
which she would fain have the world consider, as the only people 
destined to be saved; it must be owned, indeed, that they had the
true spectacle-glass, but they spoiled it by cutting upon the 
glass numerous images; and they had true faith, but they mingled 
that precious ointment with their own novel inventions, so that 
at present they see no more than the heathen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thence
we went to a barn, where stood a pert, conceited fellow preaching
with great glibness, frequently repeating the same thing three 
times.&nbsp; &ldquo;This man and his hearers,&rdquo; said the 
angel, &ldquo;possess the true spectacle-glass, to see the things
which pertain to their peace, but they lack now in their old age,
a very essential matter which is called perfect love.&nbsp; 
Various are the causes which drive folks hither; some come out of
respect to their forefathers, some out of ignorance, and many for
worldly advantage.&nbsp; They will make you believe with their 
faces that they are being strangled, but they can swallow a toad 
if necessary; and thus the princess Hypocrisy does not disdain to
teach some in barns.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;where now is the <i>Church of England</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in the city high above, it 
constitutes a great part of the <i>Catholic Church</i>, and in 
the city here below, there are some probationary churches 
belonging to it, where the English and Welsh are under probation 
for a time, in order to become qualified to have their names 
written in the book of the Catholic Church, and they who become 
so, <i>blessed are they for ever</i>.&nbsp; But <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>alas, there 
are but very few who are adapting themselves to obtain honour 
above; because, instead of looking thitherward, too many suffer 
themselves to be blinded by the three princesses below, and 
Hypocrisy keeps many with one eye upon the city above, and the 
other on that below; yea, Hypocrisy has succeeded in enticing 
many from their path, after they have overcome the three other 
deceivers.&nbsp; Come in here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and you 
will see something more;&rdquo; whereupon he carried me to the 
gallery of one of the churches in Wales, the people being in the 
midst of the service.&nbsp; And lo! some were whispering, talking
and laughing; some looking upon the pretty women; others were 
examining the dress of their neighbours from top to toe; some 
were pushing themselves forward and snarling at one another about
rank; some were dozing; others were busily engaged in their 
devotions, but many of these were playing a hypocritical 
part.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have not seen yet,&rdquo; said the angel, 
&ldquo;no, not amongst the infidels, shamelessness as open and 
barefaced as this: but thus, alas, we see <i>that the corruption 
of the best thing is the corruption worst of 
all</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The congregation then proceeded to take the
sacrament, and every one displayed reverential feelings at the 
altar.</p>
<p>However, (through the glass of my companion,) I could see one 
receiving the bread into his belly, under the figure of a 
<i>mastiff</i>, another under that of a <i>swine</i>, another 
like a <i>mole</i>, another like a <i>winged serpent</i>, and a 
few, O how very few, receiving a ray of celestial light with the 
bread and the wine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yonder,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;is a roundhead who is about to become sheriff, and because
the law enjoins, that every one shall receive the communion in 
the church before he obtains the office, he has come hither 
rather than lose it; but though there are many here who rejoice 
at seeing him, there has been no joy <!-- page 28--><a 
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>amongst us 
for his conversion, for he has only turned for the time; and thus
you see how bold Hypocrisy must be to present herself at the 
altar before Emmanuel, who is not to be deceived.&nbsp; But 
however great she be in the city of Perdition, she can effect 
nothing in the city of Emmanuel, above the wall 
yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon we turned our faces from the great city of 
Perdition, and went up to the other little city.&nbsp; In going 
along I could see at the upper end of the streets, many turning 
half-way from the temptations of the <i>gates of Perdition</i>, 
and seeking for the <i>gate of Life</i>; but whether it was that 
they failed to find it, or grew tired upon the way, I could not 
see that any went through, except one sorrowful faced man, who 
ran forward resolutely, while thousands on each side of him were 
calling him fool, some scoffing him, others threatening, him and 
his friends laying hold upon him, and entreating him not to take 
a step by which he would lose the whole world at once.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I only lose,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a very small portion 
of it, and if I should lose the whole, pray what loss is 
it?&nbsp; For what is there in the world so desirable, unless a 
man should desire deceit, and violence, and misery, and 
wretchedness, giddiness and distraction.&nbsp; <i>Contentment and
tranquillity</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;constitute the happiness
of man; but in your city there are no such things to be 
found.&nbsp; Because who is there here content with his 
station?&nbsp; <i>Higher</i>, <i>higher</i>, is what every one 
endeavours to be in the street of <i>Pride</i>; give, give us a 
little more, says every one in the street of <i>Lucre</i>; sweet,
sweet, pray give me some more of it, is the cry of every one in 
the street of <i>Pleasure</i>.&nbsp; And as for tranquillity, 
where is it? and who obtains it?&nbsp; If you be a great man, 
flattery and envy are killing you; if you be poor, every one is 
trampling upon and despising <!-- page 29--><a 
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>you; after 
having become an inventor, if you exalt your head and seek for 
praise, you will be called a boaster and a coxcomb; if you lead a
godly life and resort to the church and the altar, you will be 
called a hypocrite; if you do not, then you are an infidel or a 
heretic; if you be merry, you will be called a buffoon; if you 
are silent, you will be called a morose wretch; if you follow 
honesty, you are nothing but a simple fool; if you go neat, you 
are proud, if not, a swine; if you are smooth speaking, then you 
are false, or a trifler without meaning; if you are rough, you 
are an arrogant, disagreeable devil.&nbsp; Behold the world that 
you magnify,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;pray take my share of 
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon he shook himself loose from them all, 
and away he went undauntedly to the narrow gate, and in spite of 
every obstacle he pushed his way through, we following him; while
many men dressed in black upon the walls, on both sides of the 
gate, kept inviting the man and praising him.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are the men above dressed in 
black?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The watchmen of the king 
Emmanuel,&rdquo; replied the angel, &ldquo;who, in the name of 
their master, are inviting people and assisting them through this
gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time we were by the gate; it was very low and narrow, 
and mean in comparison with the lower gates.&nbsp; On the two 
sides of the door were the <i>ten commandments</i>; upon the 
first slab on the right side was written, &ldquo;<i>love the Lord
with thy whole heart</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>,&rdquo; and upon the 
second slab on the other side, &ldquo;love thy neighbour as 
thyself;&rdquo; and above the whole, &ldquo;<i>love not the world
nor the things which are therein</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had not 
looked long before the watchmen began to cry out to the men of 
Perdition, &ldquo;Flee! flee, for your lives!&rdquo;&nbsp; Only a
very few turned towards them once, some of whom asked, 
&ldquo;flee from what?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;From the prince of 
this world, who reigns in the <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>children of 
disobedience,&rdquo; said the watchman; &ldquo;flee from the 
pollutions which are in the world through the lusts of the flesh,
the lusts of the eyes, and the vanities of life; flee from the 
wrath which is coming to overwhelm you!&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What,&rdquo; exclaimed the other watchman, &ldquo;is your 
beloved city but a vast glowing roof cast over Hell, and if you 
were here, you might see the fire on the farther side of your 
walls kindling, to burn you down into Hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some 
mocked them, others threatened to stone them unless they ceased 
their unmannerly prate; but some few asked, &ldquo;whither shall 
we fly?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hither,&rdquo; said the watchman, 
&ldquo;fly hither to your lawful king, who yet offers you pardon 
through us, if you return to your obedience, and abandon the 
rebel Belial and his deceitful daughters.&nbsp; Though their 
appearance is so splendid, it is only deception; Belial at home 
is but a very poor prince, he has only you for fuel, and only you
as roast and boiled to gnaw, and you are never sufficient, and 
there will never be an end to his hunger and your torments.&nbsp;
And who would serve such a malicious butcher, in a temporary 
delirium here, and in eternal torments hereafter, who could 
obtain a life of happiness under a king merciful and charitable 
to his subjects, who is ever doing towards them the good offices 
of a shepherd, and endeavouring to keep them from Belial, in 
order finally to give to each of them the kingdom in the country 
of Light?&nbsp; O fools! will ye take the horrible enemy whose 
throat is burning with thirst for your blood, instead of the 
compassionate prince who has given his own blood to assist 
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; But it did not appear that these reasonings, 
which were sufficient to soften a rock, proved of much advantage 
to them, and the principal cause of their being so unsuccessful 
was, that not many had leisure to hear, the greater part being 
employed in looking at the <!-- page 31--><a 
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>gates; and of
those who did hear, there were not many who heeded, and of those 
there were not many who long remembered; some would not believe 
that it was Belial whom they were serving, others could not 
conceive that yonder little, untrodden passage was the gate of 
Life, and would not believe that the three other glittering gates
were delusion, the castle preventing them from seeing their 
destruction till they rushed upon it.</p>
<p>At this moment there came a troop of people from the street of
Pride, and knocked at the gate with great confidence but they 
were all so stiffnecked, that they could never go into a place so
low, without soiling their perriwigs and their plumes, so they 
walked back in great ill humour.&nbsp; At the tail of these came 
a party from the street of Lucre.&nbsp; Said one, &ldquo;is this 
the gate of Life?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; replied the 
watchmen who were above.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is to be done,&rdquo; 
said he, &ldquo;in order to pass through?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Read on each side of the door, and you will 
learn.&rdquo;&nbsp; The miser read the ten commandments.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;will say, that I have broken 
one of these?&rdquo;&nbsp; But on looking aloft and seeing, 
&ldquo;<i>love not the world</i>, <i>nor the things that are 
therein</i>,&rdquo; he started, and could not swallow that 
difficult sentence.&nbsp; There was among them an envious 
pig-tail who turned back on reading, &ldquo;<i>love thy neighbour
as thyself</i>;&rdquo; and a perjurer, and a slanderer turned 
abruptly back on reading, &ldquo;<i>bear not false 
witness</i>;&rdquo; some physicians on reading, &ldquo;<i>thou 
shalt commit no murder</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed &ldquo;this is no 
place for us.&rdquo;&nbsp; To be brief, every one saw there 
something which troubled him, so they all went back to chew the 
cud.&nbsp; I may add, that there was not one of these people, but
had so many bags and writings stuck about him, that he could 
never have gone through a place so narrow, even if he had made 
the attempt.</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>Presently there came a drove from the street of Pleasure
walking towards the gate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please to inform 
us,&rdquo; said one to the watchman, &ldquo;to what place this 
road is leading?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This is the road,&rdquo; 
said the watchman, &ldquo;which leads to eternal joy and 
happiness;&rdquo; whereupon they all strove to get through, but 
they failed, for some had too much belly for a place so narrow; 
others were too weak to push, having been enfeebled by women, who
impeded them moreover with their foolish whims.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said the watchman who was looking upon them, 
&ldquo;it is of no use for you to attempt to go through with your
vain toys; you must leave your pots, and your dishes, and your 
harlots, and all your other ware behind you, and then make 
haste.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How should we live then?&rdquo; said 
the fiddler, who would have been through long ago, but for fear 
of breaking his instrument.&nbsp; &ldquo;O,&rdquo; said the 
watchman, &ldquo;you must take the word of the king, for sending 
you whatsover things may be for your advantage.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Hey, hey,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;<i>a bird in the hand is
worth two in the bush</i>;&rdquo; and thereupon they all 
unanimously turned back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come through now,&rdquo; said the angel, and he drew me
in, and the first thing I saw in the porch was a large baptismal 
font, and by the side of it a spring of saline water.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Why is this here at the entrance of the road?&rdquo; said 
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; said the angel, &ldquo;because
every one must wash himself therein, previous to obtaining honour
in the palace of Emmanuel; it is termed the <i>fountain of 
repentance</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Above I could see written, 
&ldquo;<i>this is the gate of the Lord</i>, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
The porch and also the street expanded, and became less difficult
as one went forward.&nbsp; When we had gone a little way up the 
street I could hear a soft voice behind me saying, &ldquo;<i>this
is the road</i>, <i>walk in it</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The street was 
up-hill but was very clean and straight, and though the houses 
were lower here than in the city of <i>Perdition</i>, yet they 
were more pleasant.&nbsp; If there is <!-- page 33--><a 
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>here less 
wealth, there is also less strife and care; if there are fewer 
dishes, there are fewer diseases; if there is less noise, there 
is also less sadness, and more pure joy.&nbsp; I was surprised at
the calmness and the delightful tranquillity that reigned here, 
so little resembling what I had found below.&nbsp; Instead of 
swearing and cursing, buffoonery, debauchery, and drunkenness; 
instead of pride and vanity, torpor in the one corner, and riot 
in the other; instead of all the loud broiling, and the boasting 
and bustling, and chattering, which were incessantly stupifying a
man yonder; and instead of the numberless constant evils to be 
found below, you here saw sobriety, affability and cheerfulness, 
peace and thankfulness, clemency, innocence, and content upon the
face of every body.&nbsp; No weeping here, except for the 
pollutions pervading the city of the enemy; no hatred or anger, 
except against sin; and that same hatred and anger against sin, 
always accompanied with a certainty of being able to subdue it; 
no fear but of incensing the King, who was ever more ready to 
forgive than be angry with his subjects; and here there was no 
sound but of psalms of praise to the heavenly guardian.</p>
<p>By this time we had come in sight of a building superlatively 
beautiful.&nbsp; O, how glorious it was!&nbsp; No one in the city
of Perdition&mdash;neither the Turk nor the Mogul, nor any of the
others, possessed any thing equal to it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold the 
<i>Catholic Church</i>!&rdquo; said the angel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it
here that Emmanuel keeps his court?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;this is his only 
terrestrial palace.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Has he any crowned heads 
under him?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;A few,&rdquo; was the 
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are your good queen Anne, and some 
princes of Denmark and Germany, and a few of the other small 
princes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What are they,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;compared with those who are under Belial the Great?&nbsp; 
He has emperors <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>and kings without 
number.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Notwithstanding all this;&rdquo; said
the angel, &ldquo;not one of them can move a finger without the 
permission of Emmanuel, nor Belial himself either, because 
Emmanuel is his lawful king; Belial rebelled, and for his 
rebellion was made a captive, with permission however to visit 
for a little time the city of Perdition, and delude any one he 
could into his own rebellion and a share of his punishment.&nbsp;
So great is his malice, that he is continually using this 
permission, though aware that by so doing he will only add to his
own misery; and so great is his love of wickedness, that he takes
advantage of his half liberty, to seek to destroy this city and 
this edifice, though he has long known that their guardian is 
invincible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, my lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;may we approach 
and take a more minute view of this magnificent palace?&rdquo; 
for my heart had warmed towards the place at the first 
sight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly you may,&rdquo; said the angel, 
&ldquo;because there I have my place, charge, and 
employment.&rdquo;&nbsp; The nearer we went to it, the more I 
wondered, seeing how lofty, strong, beautiful, pure, and lovely 
every part of it was; how accurate was the workmanship, and how 
fair were its materials.&nbsp; A rock wrought with immense 
labour, and of prodigious strength was the foundation stone; 
living stones were placed upon this rock, and were cemented in so
admirable a manner, that it was impossible for one stone to be so
beautiful in another place, as it was in its own.&nbsp; I could 
see one part of the <i>church</i> which cast out a very fair and 
remarkable cross, and the angel perceiving me gazing upon it 
asked me &ldquo;if I knew that part.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did not know 
what to answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is the <i>Church of 
England</i>,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; These words made me observe it
with more attention than before, and on looking up I could <!-- 
page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
35</span>perceive queen Anne, on the pinnacle of the building, 
with a sword in each hand.&nbsp; With the one in her left, which 
is called Justice, she preserves her subjects from the men of the
city of Perdition; and with the other in her right, which is the 
sword of the Spirit, or the word of God, she preserves them from 
Belial and his spiritual evils.&nbsp; Under the left sword were 
the <i>Laws of England</i>; under the other was a large 
<i>Bible</i>.&nbsp; The sword of the Spirit was fiery and of 
prodigious length, it would kill at a distance to which the other
sword could not reach.&nbsp; I observed the other princes with 
the same arms, defending their portions of the church; but I 
could see that the portion of my queen was the fairest, and that 
her arms were the most bright.&nbsp; By her right hand, I could 
see a multitude of people in black&mdash;archbishops, bishops, 
and teachers, assisting her in sustaining the sword of the 
Spirit; and some of the soldiers and civil officers, and a few, 
very few of the lawyers, supporting, along with her, the other 
sword.&nbsp; I obtained permission to rest a little by one of the
magnificent doors, whither people were coming to obtain the 
dignity of the <i>universal church</i>; a tall angel was keeping 
the door, and the church within side was so vividly light, that 
it was useless for <i>Hypocrisy</i> to show her visage 
there&mdash;she sometimes appeared at the door, but never went 
in.&nbsp; After I had been gazing about a quarter of an hour, 
there came a <i>papist</i>, who imagined that the Pope possessed 
the catholic church, and he claimed his share of dignity.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What proof of your dignity have you?&rdquo; said the 
porter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have plenty,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of 
<i>traditions of the fathers</i>, and <i>acts of the congresses 
of the church</i>; but what further assurance do I need, than the
word of the Pope, who sits upon the infallible 
chair?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the porter proceeded to open an 
exceedingly large Bible.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; <!-- page 
36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>said 
he, &ldquo;the only Statute Book which we use here, prove your 
claim out of that, or depart;&rdquo; whereupon he departed.</p>
<p>At this moment there came a drove of Quakers, who wanted to go
in with their hats upon their heads, but they were turned back 
for their unmannerly behaviour.&nbsp; After that, some of the 
children of the barn, who had been there for some time, began to 
speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;no other 
statute than you, therefore show us our dignity.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said the glittering porter, looking them 
fixedly in the face, &ldquo;and I will show you something.&nbsp; 
Do you see yonder,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the rent which you made
in the church, that you might go out of it, without the slightest
cause or reason? and now, what do you want here?&nbsp; Go back to
the narrow gate, wash yourselves well in the fountain of 
repentance, in order to free yourselves from some of the kingly 
blood, in which you steeped yourselves formerly; bring some of 
that water to moisten the clay, to close up the rent yonder, and 
then, and then only, you shall be welcome.&rdquo;&nbsp; But 
before we had proceeded a rood farther towards the west, we heard
a buzz amongst the princes above, and every one, great and small,
seized his arms, and proceeded to harness himself as if for 
battle; and before we had time to espy a place to flee to, the 
whole air became dark, and the city was more deeply over-shadowed
than during an eclipse; the thunder began to roar, and the 
lightnings to dart forkedly, and a ceaseless shower of mortal 
arrows, was directed from the gates below, against the catholic 
church; and unless every one had had a shield in his hand to 
receive the fiery darts, and unless the foundation stone had been
too strong for any thing to make an impression upon it, you would
have seen the whole in conflagration.&nbsp; But alas! this was 
but the prologue, or a foretaste of what was to follow; for the 
darkness <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>speedily became seven times blacker, 
and <i>Belial</i> himself appeared upon the densest cloud, and 
around him were his choicest warriors, both terrestrial and 
infernal, to receive and execute his will, on their particular 
sides.&nbsp; He had enjoined the Pope, and the king of France, 
his other son, to destroy the church of England and its queen; 
and the Turk and the Muscovite, to break to pieces the other 
parts of the Church, and to slay the people; the queen and the 
other princes, were by no means to be spared; and the Bible was 
to be burned in spite of every thing.&nbsp; The first thing which
the queen and the other saints did, was to fall upon their knees,
and complain of their wrongs to the King of kings, in these 
words:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>The spreading of his wings covereth the 
extent of thy land</i>, <i>O Emmanuel</i>!&rdquo; Isaiah 8. 
iii.&nbsp; This complaint was answered by a voice, which said, 
&ldquo;<i>resist the devil and he will flee from you</i>;&rdquo; 
and then ensued the hardest and most stubborn engagement, which 
had ever been upon the earth.&nbsp; When the <i>sword of the 
Spirit</i> began to be waved, Belial and his infernal legions 
began to retreat, and the Pope to falter.&nbsp; The king of 
France, it is true, held out; yet even he nearly lost heart, for 
he saw the queen and her subjects united and prosperous, whilst 
his own ships were sunk, his soldiers slaughtered, and thousands 
of his subjects rebelling.&nbsp; The very Turk was becoming as 
gentle as a lamb; but just at that moment my heavenly associate 
quitted me, darting up towards the firmament, to myriads of other
shining powers, and my dream was at an end.&nbsp; Yes, just as 
the Pope and the other terrestrial powers, were beginning to 
sneak away, and to faint, and the potentates of hell to fall by 
tens of thousands, each making, to my imagination&rsquo;s ear, as
much noise as if a huge mountain had been precipitated into the 
depths of the sea, my companion quitted me, and <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>there was an 
end of my dream; for what with the noise made by the fiends, and 
the agitation which I felt at losing my companion, I awoke from 
my sleep, and returned with the utmost reluctance to my sluggish 
clod, thinking how noble and delightful it was to be a 
<i>free</i> spirit, to wander about in angelic company, quite 
secure, though seemingly in the midst of peril.&nbsp; I had now 
nothing to console me, save the Muse, and she being half angry, 
would do nothing more than bleat to me the following strains.</p>
<h3>The Perishing World.</h3>
<p>O man, upon this building gaze,<br />
The mansion of the human race,<br />
The world terrestrial see!<br />
Its architect&rsquo;s the King on high,<br />
Who ne&rsquo;er was born and ne&rsquo;er will die&mdash;<br />
The blest Divinity.<br />
The world, its wall, its starlights all,<br />
Its stores, where&rsquo;er they lie,<br />
Its wondrous brute variety,<br />
Its reptiles, fish, and birds that fly,</p>

The God above, to show his love,<br />
Did give, O man, to thee.<br />
For man, for man, whom he did plan,<br />
God caus&rsquo;d arise<br />
This edifice,<br />
Equal to heaven in all but size,<br />
Beneath the sun so fair;<br />
Then it he view&rsquo;d, and that &rsquo;twas good<br />
For man, he was aware.</p>
<p>Man only sought to know at first<br />
Evil, and of the thing accursed<br />
Obtain a sample small.<br />
The sample grew a giantess,<br />
&rsquo;Tis easy from her size to guess<br />
The whole her prey will fall.<br />
Cellar and turret high,<br />
Through hell&rsquo;s dark treachery,<br />
Now reeling, rocking terribly,<br />
In swooning pangs appear;<br />
The orchards round, are only found<br />
Vile sedge and weeds to bear;<br />
The roof gives way, more, more each day,<br />
The walls too, spite<br />
Of all their might,<br />
Have frightful cracks, down all their height,<br />
Which coming ruin show;<br />
The dragons tell, that danger fell,<br />
Now lurks the house below.</p>
<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
40</span>O man! this building fair and proud,<br />
From its foundation to the cloud,<br />
Is all in dangerous plight;<br />
Beneath thee quakes and shakes the ground;<br />
&rsquo;Tis all, e&rsquo;en down to hell&rsquo;s profound,<br />
A bog that scares the sight.<br />
The sin man wrought, the deluge brought,<br />
And without fail<br />
A fiery gale,<br />
Before which every thing shall quail,<br />
His deeds shall waken now;<br />
Worse evermore, till all is o&rsquo;er,<br />
Thy case, O world, shall grow.<br />
There&rsquo;s one place free, yet, man for thee,<br />
Where mercies reign,<br />
A place to which thou may&rsquo;st attain,<br />
Seek there a residence to gain<br />
Lest thou in caverns howl;<br />
For save thou there shalt quick repair,<br />
Woe to thy wretched soul!</p>
<p>Towards yon building turn your face!<br />
Too strong by far is yonder place<br />
To lose the victory.<br />
&rsquo;Tis better than the reeling world;<br />
For all the ills by hell uphurl&rsquo;d<br />
It has a remedy.<br />
Sublime it braves the wildest waves;<br />
It is a refuge place<br />
Impregnable to Belial&rsquo;s race,<br />
With stones, emitting vivid rays,<br />

Itself, and those therein, compose<br />
The universal church.<br />
Though slaves of sin we long have been,<br />
With faith sincere<br />
We shall win pardon there;<br />
Then in let&rsquo;s press, O, brethren dear,<br />
And claim our dignity!<br />
By doing so, we saints below<br />
And saints on high shall be.</p>

43</span>A Vision of Death in his Palace Below.</h2>
<p>In one of the long, black, chilly nights of winter, when it 
was much warmer in a kitchen of Glyn-cywarch, than on the summit 
of Cadair Idris, and much more pleasant to be in a snug chamber, 
with a warm bed-fellow, than in a shroud in the church yard, I 
was mussing upon some discourses which had passed between me and 
a neighbour, upon <i>the shortness of human life</i>, and how 
certain every one is of dying, and how uncertain as to the 
time.&nbsp; Whilst thus engaged, having but newly laid my head 
down upon the pillow, and being about half awake, I felt a great 
weight coming stealthily upon me, from the crown of my head to my
heel, so that I could not stir a finger, nor any thing except my 
tongue, and beheld a lad upon my breast, and a lass mounted upon 
his back.&nbsp; On looking sharply, I guessed, from the warm 
smell which came from him, his clammy locks, and his gummy eyes, 
that the lad must be <i>master Sleep</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, 
sir,&rdquo; said I, squealing, &ldquo;what have I done to you, 
that you bring that witch here to suffocate me?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is only my sister 
<i>Nightmare</i>; <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>we are both going to visit our 
brother <i>Death</i>, and have need of a third, and lest you 
should resist, we have come upon you without warning, as he 
himself will sometime; therefore you must come, whether you will 
or not.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;must I 
die?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O no,&rdquo; said <i>Nightmare</i>; 
&ldquo;we will spare you this time.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But with 
your favour,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;your brother Death never 
spared any one yet who was brought within reach of his dart; the 
fellow even ventured to fling a fall with the Lord of Life 
himself, though it is true he gained very little by his 
daring.&rdquo;&nbsp; At these words <i>Nightmare</i> arose full 
of wrath and departed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; said 
<i>Sleep</i>, &ldquo;come away, and you shall have no cause to 
repent of your journey.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;may there never be night to <i>saint Sleep</i>, and may 
<i>Nightmare</i> never obtain any other place to crouch upon than
the top of an awl, unless you return me to where you found 
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then away he went with me, over woods and 
precipices, over oceans and valleys, over castles and towers, 
rivers and crags; and where did we descend, but by one of the 
gates of the daughters of Belial, on the posterior side of the 
<i>city of Perdition</i>, and I could there perceive, that the 
three gates of Perdition contracted into one on the hinder side, 
and opened into the same place&mdash;a place foggy, cold, and 
pestilential, replete with an unwholesome vapour, and clouds, 
lowering and terrible.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, sir,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;what dungeon of a place is this?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;<i>The chambers of Death</i>,&rdquo; said 
<i>Sleep</i>.&nbsp; I had scarcely time to enquire, before I 
heard some people crying, some screaming, some groaning, some 
talking deliriously, some uttering blasphemies in a feeble tone: 
others in great agony, as if about to give up the ghost.&nbsp; 
Here and there one, after a mighty shout would become silent, and
then forthwith I could hear a key revolving in a lock; I <!-- 
page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
45</span>turned at the sound to look for the door, and by dint of
long gazing, I could see tens of thousands of doors, apparently 
far off though close by my side notwithstanding.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Please to inform me, master Sleep,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;to what place these doors open?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They 
open,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;into the <i>land of Oblivion</i>,
a vast country under the rule of my brother Death; and the great 
wall here, is the limit of the immense eternity.&rdquo;&nbsp; As 
I looked I could see a little death at each door, all with 
different arms, and different names, though evidently they were 
all subjects of the same king.&nbsp; Notwithstanding which, there
was much contention between them concerning the sick; for the one
wished to snatch the sick through his door, and the other would 
fain have him through his own.&nbsp; On drawing near, we could 
see above every door, the name of the death written, who kept it;
and likewise by every door, hundreds of various things left 
scattered about, denoting the haste of those who went 
through.&nbsp; Over one door I could see <i>Famine</i>, though 
purses and full bags were lying on the ground beside it, and 
boxes nailed up, standing near.&nbsp; &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said 
he, &ldquo;is the gate of the <i>misers</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;To whom,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do these rags 
belong?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Principally to misers,&rdquo; he 
replied; &ldquo;but there are some there belonging to lazy 
idlers, and to ballad singers, and to others, poor in every 
thing, but spirit, who preferred starvation to 
begging.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the next door was the death of the 
<i>Ruling Passion</i>, and parallel with it I could hear many 
voices, as of men in the extremity of cold.&nbsp; By this door 
were many books, some pots and flaggons, here and there a staff 
and a walking stick, some compasses and charts, and shipping 
tackle.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is the road by which scholars 
go,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some scholars go by it,&rdquo; 
said he, &ldquo;solitary, helpless wretches, whose relations have
stripped them of their last <!-- page 46--><a 
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>article of 
raiment; but people of various other descriptions go by it 
also.&nbsp; Those,&rdquo; said he, (speaking of the pots,) 
&ldquo;are the relics of jolly companions, whose feet are 
freezing under benches, whilst their heads are boiling with drink
and uproar; and the things yonder belong to travellers of snowy 
mountains, and to traffickers in the North sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next at hand was a meagre skeleton of a figure, called the 
<i>death of Fear</i>.&nbsp; Through his exterior you might see 
that he did not possess any heart; and by his door there were 
bags, and chests also, and locks and castles.&nbsp; By this gate 
went usurers, bad governors and tyrants, and some of the 
murderers, but the plurality of the latter were driven past to 
the next gate, where there was a death called <i>Gallows</i>, 
with his cord ready for their necks.</p>
<p>Next was to be seen the <i>death of Love</i>, and by his feet 
were hundreds of instruments, and books of music, and verses, and
love letters, and also ointments and colors to beautify the 
countenance, and a thousand other embellishing wares, and also 
some swords.&nbsp; &ldquo;With some of those swords,&rdquo; said 
my companion, &ldquo;bandits have been slain whilst fighting for 
women, and with others, love-lorn creatures have stabbed 
themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could perceive that this death was 
purblind.</p>
<p>At the next door, was a death who had the most repulsive 
figure of all: his entire liver was consumed.&nbsp; He was called
the <i>death of Envy</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;This one,&rdquo; said 
Sleep, &ldquo;assaults losing gamesters, slanderers, and many a 
female rider, who repineth at the law which rendered the wife 
subject to her husband.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, sir,&rdquo; 
said I, &ldquo;what is the meaning of female rider?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Female rider,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the term used 
here, for the woman who would ride her husband, her neighbours, 
<!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
47</span>and her country too, if possible, and the end of her 
long riding will be, that she will ride the Devil, from that 
door, down to hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next stood the door of the <i>death of Ambition</i>, and of 
those who lift their nostrils on high, and break their shins for 
want of looking beneath their feet.&nbsp; Beside this door were 
crowns, sceptres, banners, all sorts of patents and commissions, 
and all kinds of heraldric and warlike arms.</p>
<p>But before I could look on any more of these countless doors, 
I heard a voice commanding me by my name to prepare.&nbsp; At 
this word, I could feel myself beginning to melt, like a snow 
ball in the heat of the sun; whereupon my master gave me some 
soporific drink, so that I fell asleep, but by the time I awoke, 
he had conveyed me to a considerable distance, on the other side 
of the wall.&nbsp; I found myself in a valley of pitchy darkness,
and as it seemed to me, limitless.&nbsp; At the end of a little 
time, I could see by a dim light, like that of a dying candle, 
innumerable human shades&mdash;some on foot, and some on 
horseback, running through one another like the wind, silently 
and with wonderful solemnity.</p>
<p>It was a desert, bare, and blasted country, without grass, or 
vegetation, or woods, and without animals, with the exception of 
deadly monsters, and venomous reptiles of every kind; serpents, 
snakes, lice, toads, maw-worms, locusts, ear-wigs, and the like, 
which all exist on human corruption.&nbsp; Through myriads of 
shades, and creeping things, graves, sepulchres, and cemeteries, 
we proceeded, without interruption, to observe the country.&nbsp;
At last I perceived some of the shades turning and looking upon 
me; and suddenly, notwithstanding the great silence that had 
prevailed before, there was a whispering from one to the other 
that there was a <i>living </i><!-- page 48--><a 
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span><i>man</i> at
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;A living man,&rdquo; said one; &ldquo;a living
man,&rdquo; said the other; and they came thronging about me like
caterpillars from every corner.&nbsp; &ldquo;How did you come 
hither, sirrah?&rdquo; said a little morkin of a death who was 
there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I know no 
more than yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What do they call 
you?&rdquo; he demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Call me what you please, 
here in your own country,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but at home I 
am called <i>the Sleeping Bard</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that word I beheld a crooked old man, with a double head 
like to a rough-barked thorn tree, raising himself erect, and 
looking upon me worse than the black devil himself; and lo! 
without saying a word, he hurled a large human skull at my 
head&mdash;many thanks to a tombstone which shielded me.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Pray be quiet, sir,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am but a
stranger, who was never here before, and you may be sure I will 
never return, if I can once reach home again.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I will give you cause to remember having been here,&rdquo;
said he; and attacked me with a thigh-bone, like a very devil, 
whilst I avoided his blows as well as I could.&nbsp; &ldquo;By 
heavens,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this is a most inhospitable 
country to strangers.&nbsp; Is there a justice of the peace 
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what 
peace do you deserve, who will not let people rest in their 
graves?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;may 
I be allowed to know your name, because I am not aware of ever 
having disturbed any one in this country.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Sirrah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;know that not you are the 
Sleeping Bard, but that I am that person; and I have been allowed
to rest here for nine hundred years, by every one but 
yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he attacked me again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forbear, my brother,&rdquo; said Merddyn, who was near 
at hand, &ldquo;be not too hot; rather be thankful to him for 
keeping an honorable remembrance of your name upon 
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Great <!-- page 49--><a 
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>honor 
forsooth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shall receive from such a 
blockhead as this.&nbsp; Sirrah! can you sing in the 
four-and-twenty measures?&nbsp; Can you carry the pedigree of Gog
and Magog, and the genealogy of Brutus ap Sylfius, up to a 
millenium previous to the fall of Troy?&nbsp; Can you narrate 
when, and what will be the end of the combats betwixt the lion 
and the eagle, and betwixt the dragon and the red 
deer?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey, hey! let me ask him a 
question,&rdquo; said another, who was seated beside a large 
cauldron which was boiling, and going, bubble, bubble, over a 
fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come nearer,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what is 
the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I till the judgment day<br />
Upon the earth shall stray;<br />
None knows for certainty<br />
Whether fish or flesh I be.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I will request the favor of your name, sir,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;that I may answer you in a suitable 
manner.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;am 
Taliesin, <a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49" 
class="citation">[49]</a> the prince of the Bards of the West, 
and that is a <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>piece of my composition.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what could be your 
meaning, unless it was, that the yellow plague <a 
name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50" 
class="citation">[50]</a> which destroyed Maelgwn of Gwynedd, put
an end to you on the sea-shore, and that your body was divided 
amongst the crows and the fishes.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Peace, 
fool!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I was alluding to my two callings, 
of man of the law and poet.&nbsp; Please to tell me, has a lawyer
more similitude to a raven, than a poet to a whale?&nbsp; How 
many a one doth a single lawyer divest of his flesh, to swell out
his own craw; and with what indifference does he extract the 
blood, and leave a man half alive!&nbsp; And as for the poet, 
where is the fish which is able to swallow like him? he is 
drinking oceans of liquor at all times, but the briny sea itself 
would not slack his thirst.&nbsp; And provided a man be a poet 
and a lawyer, how is it possible to know whether he be fish or 
flesh, especially if he be a courtier to boot, as I was, and 
obliged to vary his taste to every ones palate.&nbsp; But tell 
me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whether there are at present, any of 
those fellows upon the earth?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s 
plenty of them,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;if one can patch together 
any nonsensical derry, he is styled a graduate bard.&nbsp; But as
for the others; there is such a plague of lawyers, petty 
attornies, and scribes, that the locusts of Egypt bore light upon
the country, in comparison with them.&nbsp; In your time, sir, 
there were but bargains of tofts and crofts, and a hand&rsquo;s 
breadth of writing for a farm of a hundred pounds, and a raising 
of cairns and crosses, as memorials of the purchase and 
boundaries.&nbsp; There is no longer any such security, but there
is far more craft and deceit, and a tombstone&rsquo;s breadth of 
written parchment to secure the bargain; <!-- page 51--><a 
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>and for all 
that, it is a wonder if a flaw be not in it, or said to be at 
least.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Taliesin, 
&ldquo;I should not be worth a straw in the world at 
present.&nbsp; I am better where I am.&nbsp; Truth will never be 
had where there are many poets, nor fair dealing where there are 
many lawyers; no, nor health where there are many 
physicians.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this moment, a little grey-headed 
hobgoblin, who had heard that a living man was arrived, flung 
himself at my feet, weeping abundantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear 
me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what are you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;One 
who is grievously wronged every day in the world,&rdquo; said 
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;May God move your soul to procure justice for 
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I am called <i>Somebody</i>,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and
there is scarcely a piece of pimping, or a calumny, or a lie, or 
tale, to set people at loggerheads, but must be laid upon 
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Verily,&rsquo; says one, &lsquo;she is a 
prodigious fine girl, and she was praising you before somebody, 
notwithstanding that some very great person is paying his suit to
her.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I heard somebody,&rsquo; says another, 
&lsquo;reckoning that this estate was mortgaged nine hundred 
pounds deep.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I saw some one yesterday,&rsquo;
says the beggar, &lsquo;with a chequered slop, like a sailor, who
had come with a large ship load of corn, to the neighbouring 
port.&rsquo;&nbsp; And thus every ragged dog mangles me for his 
own wicked purposes.&nbsp; Some call me Friend&mdash;&lsquo;I was
informed by a friend,&rsquo; says one, &lsquo;that so and so has 
no intention of leaving a farthing to his wife, and that there is
no affection between them.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some others vilify me yet
more, and call me Bird&mdash;&lsquo;A bird whistled in my ear, 
that there are bad practices going on there,&rsquo; say 
they.&nbsp; It is true, some call me by the more respectable name
of Old Person; yet, not half the omens, prophecies, and counsels,
which are attributed to the Old Person, belong to me.&nbsp; I 
have never bidden people to follow the old road, <!-- page 
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
52</span>provided the new one be better, nor a hundred similar 
things.&nbsp; But Somebody is my common name,&rdquo; he 
continued, &ldquo;him you will most frequently hear, to have been
concerned in every atrocious matter.&nbsp; Because, ask a person 
wherever a vile, slanderous falsehood has been uttered, who it 
was who said it, and he will reply, &lsquo;Truly I don&rsquo;t 
know who, but somebody in the company said it;&rsquo; question 
then every one in the company concerning the fable, and every one
will say he heard it from somebody, but no one knows from 
whom.&nbsp; Is not this a shameful injury?&rdquo; he 
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be so good as to inform every one whom you
may hear naming me, that I have never said any one of these 
things, nor have ever invented nor uttered a lie to slander any 
one, nor a story to set relations by the ears; that I do not go 
near them; that I know nothing of their history, nor of their 
affairs, nor of their accursed secrets; and that they ought not 
to fling their wickedness upon me, but on their own corrupt 
brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment there came a little death, one of the 
secretaries of the king, desiring to know my name, and commanding
master Sleep, to carry me instantly before the king.&nbsp; I was 
compelled to go, though utterly against my will, by the power, 
which, like a whirlwind carried me away, betwixt high and low, 
thousands of miles back to the left hand, until we came again in 
sight of the boundary wall, and reached a narrow corner.&nbsp; 
Here we perceived an immense, frowning, ruinous palace, open at 
the top, reaching to the wall where were the innumerable doors, 
all of which led to this huge, terrific court.&nbsp; The walls 
were constructed with the sculls of men, which grinned horribly 
with their teeth.&nbsp; The clay was black, and was prepared with
tears and sweat; and the mortar on the outside was variegated 
with phlegm and pus, and on the inside <!-- page 53--><a 
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>with 
black-red blood.&nbsp; On the top of each turret, you might see a
little death, with a smoking heart stuck on the point of his 
dart.</p>
<p>Around the palace was a wood, consisting of a few poisonous 
yews and deadly cypresses, and in these, owls, blood crows, 
vultures and the like were nestling; and croaking continually for
flesh, though the whole place was nothing but a stinking 
shamble.&nbsp; We entered the gate.&nbsp; All the pillars of the 
hall were made of human thigh bones; the pillars of the parlour 
were of shank bones; and the floors were one continued layer of 
every species of offal.&nbsp; It was not long before I came in 
sight of a vast and frightful altar, where I beheld the king of 
Terrors swallowing human flesh and blood, and a thousand petty 
deaths, from every hole, feeding him with fresh, warm 
flesh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said the death who brought me 
there, addressing himself to the king, &ldquo;a spark, whom I 
found in the midst of the land of Oblivion; he came so light 
footed, that your majesty never tasted a morsel of 
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo; said the king, 
and opened his jaws as wide as an earthquake to swallow me.&nbsp;
Whereupon I turned all trembling to Sleep.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was 
I,&rdquo; said Sleep, &ldquo;who brought him here.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the meagre, grizly king, turning to me, 
&ldquo;for my brother Sleep&rsquo;s sake, you shall be permitted 
to return this time, but beware of me the next.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
After having employed himself for a considerable time in casting 
carcasses into his insatiable paunch, he caused his subjects to 
be called together, and moved from the altar to a terrific throne
of exceeding height, to pronounce judgment on the prisoners newly
arrived.&nbsp; In an instant came innumerable multitudes of the 
dead, making their obeisance to their king, and taking their 
stations in remarkable order.&nbsp; And lo! king Death was <!-- 
page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
54</span>in his regal vest of flaming scarlet, covered all over 
with figures of women and children weeping, and men uttering 
groans; about his head was a black-red three-cornered cap (which 
his friend Lucifer had sent as a present to him,) and upon its 
corners were written <i>misery</i>, <i>wailing</i>, and 
<i>woe</i>.&nbsp; Above his head were thousands of 
representations of battles on sea and land, towns burning, the 
earth opening, and the great water of the deluge; and beneath his
feet nothing was to be seen but the crowns and sceptres of the 
kings whom he had overcome from the beginning.&nbsp; On his right
hand Fate was sitting, seemingly engaged in reading, with a murky
look, a huge volume which was before him; and on his left was an 
old man called <i>Time</i>, licking innumerable threads of gold, 
and silver, and copper, and very many of iron.&nbsp; Some few of 
the threads were growing better towards their end, and thousands 
growing worse.&nbsp; Along the threads were hours, days, and 
years; and Fate, according as his volume directed him, was 
continually breaking the threads of life, and opening the doors 
of the boundary wall, betwixt the two worlds.</p>
<p>We had not looked around us long, before we heard four 
fiddlers, newly dead, summoned to the bar.&nbsp; &ldquo;How comes
it,&rdquo; said the king of Terrors, &ldquo;that loving merriment
as ye do, ye kept not on the other side of the gulf, for there 
has never been any merriment on this side.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
have never done,&rdquo; said one of the musicians, &ldquo;harm to
any body, but have rendered people joyous, and have taken quietly
what they gave us for our pains.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said Death, 
&ldquo;did you never keep any one from his work, and cause him to
lose his time; or did you never keep people from church? 
ha!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O no!&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;perhaps
now and then on a Sunday, after service, we may have kept some in
the public house till the next morning, or <!-- page 55--><a 
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>during summer
tide, may have kept them dancing in the ring on the green all 
night; for sure enough, we were more liked, and more lucky in 
obtaining a congregation than the parson.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Away, away with these fellows to the country of 
Despair!&rdquo; said the terrific king, &ldquo;bind the four back
to back and cast them to their customers, to dance bare-footed on
floors of glowing heat, and to amble to all eternity without 
either praise or music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next that came to the bar was a certain king, who had 
lived very near to Rome.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold up your hand, 
prisoner,&rdquo; said one of the officers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
hope,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you have some better manners 
and favour to show to a king.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirrah,&rdquo; 
said Death, &ldquo;why did you not keep on the other side of the 
gulf where all are kings?&nbsp; On this side there is none but 
myself, and another down below, and you will soon see, that 
neither he nor I will rate you according to the degree of your 
majesty, but according to the degree of your wickedness, in order
to adapt your punishment to your crimes, therefore answer to the 
interrogation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he replied, 
&ldquo;I would have you know, that you have no authority to 
detain me, nor to interrogate me, as I have a pardon for all my 
sins under the Pope&rsquo;s own hand.&nbsp; On account of my 
faithful services, he has given me a warrant to go straight to 
Paradise, without tarrying one moment in Purgatory.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
At these words the king and all the haggard train gave a ghastly 
grin, to escape from laughing outright; but the other full of 
wrath at their ridicule, commanded them aloud to show him the 
way.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peace, thou lost fool!&rdquo; cried Death, 
&ldquo;Purgatory lies behind you, on the other side of the wall, 
for you ought to purify yourself during your life; and on the 
right hand, on the other side of that gulf is Paradise.&nbsp; But
there is no road by which <!-- page 56--><a 
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>it is 
possible for you to escape, either through the gulf to Paradise, 
or through the boundary wall back to the world; and if you were 
to give your kingdom, (supposing you could give it,) you would 
not obtain permission from the keepers of those doors, to take 
one peep through the key hole.&nbsp; It is called the 
irrepassable wall, for when once you have come through you may 
abandon all hope of returning.&nbsp; But since you stand so high 
on the books of the Pope, you shall go and prepare his bed, 
beside that of the Pope who was before him, and there you shall 
kiss his toe for ever, and he the toe of Lucifer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately thereupon, four little deaths raised the poor king
up, who was by this time shivering like the leaf of an aspen, and
snatched him out of sight like lightning.&nbsp; Next after him 
came a young fellow and woman.&nbsp; He had been a jolly 
companion and she a lady of pleasure, or one free of her person; 
but they were called here by their naked names, drunkard and 
harlot.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said the drunkard, &ldquo;I 
shall find some favour with you; I have sent to you many a 
bloated booty in a torrent of good ale; and when I failed to kill
others, I came myself, willingly, to feed you.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;With the permission of the court,&rdquo; said the harlot, 
&ldquo;you have not sent half as much as I, and my offerings were
burning sacrifices, rich roast meat ready for the 
board.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey, hey!&rdquo; said Death, 
&ldquo;all this was done for your own accursed passions&rsquo; 
sake and not to feed me.&nbsp; Bind the two face to face, as they
are old acquaintances, and cast them into the land of Darkness, 
and let each be a torment to the other, until the day of 
judgment.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were then snatched away, with their 
heads downwards.</p>
<p>Next to these there came seven recorders.&nbsp; Having been 
commanded to raise their hands to the bar, they would by no <!-- 
page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
57</span>means obey, as the rails were greasy.&nbsp; One began to
wrangle boisterously; &ldquo;we ought to obtain a fair citation 
to prepare our answer;&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;instead of being 
rushed upon unawares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are we bound to give you that same specific 
citation,&rdquo; answered Death, &ldquo;since you obtain in every
place, and at every period of your life, warning of my 
coming.&nbsp; How many sermons have you not heard upon the 
mortality of man?&nbsp; How many books have you not seen?&nbsp; 
How many graves, how many sculls, how many diseases, how many 
messages and signs have you not had?&nbsp; What is your Sleep, 
but my own brother?&nbsp; What are sculls, but my visage?&nbsp; 
What does your daily food consist of but dead creatures?&nbsp; 
Seek not to cast your neglect upon me.&nbsp; Speak not of 
summons, when you have obtained it a hundred times.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; said one red recorder, &ldquo;what have you 
to advance against us?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said 
Death.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drinking the sweat and blood of the poor, and
levying double your wages.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is an honest 
man,&rdquo; replied the recorder, pointing to a pettifogger 
behind him, &ldquo;who knows that we have never done any thing 
but what was fair; and it is not fair of you to detain us here, 
without a specific crime to prove against us.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Hey, hey!&rdquo; said Death, &ldquo;you shall prove 
against yourselves.&nbsp; Place these people,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;on the verge of the <i>precipice</i> before the tribunal 
of <i>Justice</i>, they shall obtain equity there though they 
never practiced it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were still seven other prisoners remaining, and these 
kept up a prodigious bustle and noise.&nbsp; Some were 
flattering, others quarrelling, some blustering, some 
counselling, &amp;c.&nbsp; Scarcely had they been called to the 
bar, when lo! the entire palace became seven times more horribly 
dark than before, and there was a shivering and a great agitation
about <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the throne, and Death became paler 
than ever.&nbsp; Upon enquiring what was the matter, one of the 
messengers of Lucifer stepped forward with a letter for Death, 
concerning these seven prisoners, and Fate presently caused the 
letter to be read publicly, and these were the words, as far as I
can remember.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Lucifer</i>, <i>King of the kings of the
world</i>, <i>prince of Hell</i>, <i>and ruler of the Deep</i>, 
<i>to our natural son</i>, <i>the most mighty and terrible king 
Death</i>, <i>greeting</i>, <i>pre-eminence</i>, <i>and eternal 
spoil</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For as much as we have been informed by some of our 
nimble messengers, who are constantly abroad to obtain 
information, that seven prisoners, of the seven most villainous 
and dangerous species in the world, have arrived lately at your 
royal palace, and that it is your intention to hurl them over the
cliff into my kingdom.&nbsp; I hereby counsel you to try every 
possible means, to let them loose back again upon the world; they
will do you there more service in sending you food, and sending 
me better company, for I would rather want than have them; we 
have had but too much plague with their companions for a long 
time, and my dominion is still disturbed by them.&nbsp; Therefore
turn them back, or keep them with you.&nbsp; For, by the infernal
crown, if you send them here, I will undermine the foundations of
your kingdom, until it falls down into my own immense 
dominion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>From the burning hall of assembly</i>, <i>at our 
royal palace in the pit of Hell</i>, <i>in the year of our 
reign</i>, 5425.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>King Death, hereupon, stood for some time with his visage 
green and pale, in great perplexity of mind.&nbsp; But <!-- page 
59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
59</span>whilst he was meditating, behold <i>Fate</i>, turned 
upon him such an iron-black scowl, as made him tremble.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Sirrah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;look to what you do.&nbsp; 
It is not in my power to send any one back, through the boundary 
of eternity, the irrepassable wall, nor in yours to harbour them 
here; therefore forward them to their destruction, in spite of 
the Arch Fiend.&nbsp; He has been able hitherto, in a minute to 
allot his proper place to every individual, in a drove of a 
thousand, nay, even of ten thousand captured souls; and what 
difficulty can he have with seven, however dangerous they may 
be.&nbsp; But though these seven should turn the infernal 
government topsy-turvy, do you drive them thither instantly, for 
fear I should receive commands to annihilate you before your 
time.&nbsp; As for <i>his</i> threats, they are only lies; for 
although thy end, and that of the old man yonder, (looking at 
Time,) are nigh at hand, being written only a few pages further 
on, in my unerring volume, yet you have no cause to be afraid of 
sinking to Lucifer; though every one in the abyss would be glad 
to obtain thee, yet they never, never shall.&nbsp; For the rocks 
of steel and eternal adamant, which form the roof of Hell, are 
too strong for anything to crumble them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon, 
Death, considerably startled, called to one of his train, to 
write for him the following answer.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Death</i>, <i>the king of Terror and 
Conqueror of conquerors</i>, <i>to his revered friend and 
neighbour Lucifer</i>, <i>king of Eternal Night</i>, <i>sovereign
of the Bottomless Pool</i>, <i>sends greeting</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After due reflection on your regal desire, it has 
appeared to us more advantageous, not only to our own dominion, 
but likewise to your own extensive kingdom, to send these <!-- 
page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
60</span>prisoners, as far as possible from the doors of the 
irrepassable wall, lest their putrid odour should terrify the 
whole city of Destruction, so that no man should come to all 
eternity, to my side of the gate; and neither I obtain any thing 
to cool my sting, nor you a concourse of customers from earth to 
hell.&nbsp; Therefore I will leave to you to judge them, and to 
hurl them into such cells, as you may deem the most proper and 
secure for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>From my nether palace in the great gate of 
Perdition</i>, <i>over Destruction</i>.&nbsp; <i>In the year</i>,
<i>from the renewal of my kingdom</i>, 1670.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At hearing all this, I felt a great curiosity to know who 
these seven people could be, whom the devils themselves held in 
so much dread.&nbsp; But ere a minute had elapsed, the clerk of 
the crown called their names, as follows:&mdash;Master Meddler, 
alias <i>Finger in Every Dish</i>; but he was so vehement and 
busy in advising the others, that he could not get a 
moment&rsquo;s time to answer for himself, until Death threatened
to transfix him with his dart.</p>
<p>Then <i>master Slanderer</i> was called, alias <i>Enemy of 
Fair Fame</i>; but there was no answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is too 
modest to hear his titles,&rdquo; said the third, &ldquo;and he 
never can bear his nicknames.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you 
suppose,&rdquo; said the <i>Slanderer</i>, &ldquo;that you 
yourself have no <i>titles</i>.&nbsp; Call for,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;<i>master Coxcomb</i>, alias <i>Smooth Gullet</i>, alias 
<i>Poison Smile</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; said a 
woman who was there, pointing to the Coxcomb.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;<i>madam Bouncer</i>!&nbsp; Your
humble servant, I am overjoyed at seeing you well.&nbsp; I have 
never seen a woman look handsomer in breeches.&nbsp; But, oh! to 
think how miserable the country must be behind you, for want of 
its admirable she-governor; <!-- page 61--><a 
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>yet your 
delightful company will make hell itself something 
better.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O son of the arch fiend!&rdquo; said 
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;With you there is no need of another hell, you 
are yourself enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the cryer called 
<i>Bouncer</i>, or <i>mistress Breeches</i>.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; said another.&nbsp; But she said not a word,
for want of being called madam.&nbsp; Next was called 
<i>Contriver of Contrivances</i>, alias <i>Jack of all 
Trades</i>; but he returned no answer either, for he was busied 
in devising a way to escape.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ready, ready,&rdquo; 
said one behind, &ldquo;here he is, looking out for an 
opportunity to break through your palace, and unless you take 
care, he will have some notable contrivance to baulk 
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said the Contriver, &ldquo;call him, I beseech 
you, <i>master Impeacher of his Brother</i>, alias <i>Searcher of
Faults</i>, alias <i>Framer of Complaints</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Ready, ready, this is he,&rdquo; said a litigious 
pettifogger, for every one knew the name of the other, but would 
not acknowledge his own.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall be called,&rdquo;
said the Impeacher, &ldquo;<i>master Litigious Pettifogger</i>, 
alias <i>the Courts Comprised</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bear 
witness, I pray you all,&rdquo; said the Pettifogger, &ldquo;as 
to what the knave called me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo; 
said Death, &ldquo;not by the baptismal font, but by his sins, is
every one called in this country; and, with your permission, 
master Pettifogger, the names of your sins are those which shall 
stick to you henceforth for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo;
said the Pettifogger, &ldquo;I swear by the Devil that I will 
make you smart for this.&nbsp; Though you are empowered to kill 
me, you have no authority to bestow nicknames upon me.&nbsp; I 
will file a complaint against you for defamation, and another for
false imprisonment, against you and your friend Lucifer, in the 
court of Justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time, I beheld the legions of Death, formed in order 
and armed, with their eyes fixed upon the king, awaiting <!-- 
page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
62</span>the word.&nbsp; &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the king, 
standing erect upon his regal throne, &ldquo;my terrible and 
invincible hosts, spare neither care nor diligence in removing 
these prisoners from out of my boundaries, lest they prove the 
ruin of my country; cast them bound, over the precipice of 
Despair, with their heads downward.&nbsp; But for the seventh, 
this Courts Comprised, who threatens me, leave him free over the 
chasm, beneath the court of <i>Justice</i>, and let him try 
whether he can make his complaint good against me.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Then Death reseated himself.&nbsp; And lo! all the deadly 
legions, after surrounding the prisoners and binding them, led 
them away to their couch.&nbsp; I also went out, and peeped after
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come away,&rdquo; said Sleep, and snatched me 
up to the top of the highest turret of the palace.&nbsp; Thence I
could see the prisoners proceeding to their eternal 
perdition.&nbsp; Presently a whirlwind arose, and dispersed the 
pitch-black cloud, which was spread universally over the face of 
the land of Oblivion, and by the light of a thousand candles, 
which were burning with a blue flame, at a particular place, I 
obtained a far distant view of the verge of the <i>Bottomless 
Gulf</i>, a sight exceedingly horrible; and also of a spectacle 
above, still more appalling, namely <i>Justice</i> upon his 
<i>supreme seat</i>, holding the keys of Hell, at a separate and 
distinct tribunal over the chasm, to pronounce judgment upon the 
damned as they came.&nbsp; I could see the prisoners cast 
headlong down the gulf, and Pettifogger rushing to fling himself 
over the terrific brink, rather than look once on the court of 
<i>Justice</i>.&nbsp; For oh! there was there a spectacle too 
severe for a guilty countenance.&nbsp; I merely gazed from 
<i>afar</i>, but I beheld more terrific horror, than I can at 
present relate, or I could at that time support, for my spirit 
struggled and fluttered at the awful sight, and wrestled so 
strenuously, that <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>it burst all the bands of Sleep, and 
my soul returned to its accustomed functions.&nbsp; And 
exceedingly overjoyed I was to see myself still amongst the 
living.&nbsp; I instantly determined upon reforming myself, as a 
hundred years of affliction in the paths of righteousness, would 
be less harrowing to me, than another glance on the horrors of 
this night.</p>
<h3>Death the Great.</h3>
<p>Leave land and house we must some day,<br />
For human sway not long doth bide;<br />
Leave pleasures and festivities,<br />
And pedigrees, our boast and pride.</p>
<p>Leave strength and loveliness of mien,<br />
Wit sharp and keen, experience dear;<br />
Leave learning deep, and much lov&rsquo;d friends,<br />
And all that tends our life to cheer.</p>
<p><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
64</span>From Death then is there no relief?<br />
That ruthless thief and murderer fell,<br />
Who to his shambles beareth down<br />
All, all we own, and us as well.</p>
<p>Ye monied men, ye who would fain<br />
Your wealth retain eternally,<br />
How brave &rsquo;twould be a sum to raise,<br />
And the good grace of Death to buy!</p>
<p>How brave! ye who with beauty beam,<br />
On rank supreme who fix your mind,<br />
Should ye your captivations muster,<br />
And with their lustre king Death blind.</p>
<p>O ye who are at foot most light,<br />
Who are in the height now of your spring,<br />
Fly, fly, and ye will make us gape,<br />
If ye can scape Death&rsquo;s cruel fling.</p>
<p>The song and dance afford, I ween,<br />
Relief from spleen, and sorrows grave;<br />
How very strange there is no dance,<br />
Nor tune of France, from Death can save!</p>
<p>Ye travellers of sea and land,<br />
Who know each strand below the sky;<br />
Declare if ye have seen a place,<br />
Where Adam&rsquo;s race can Death defy!</p>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
65</span>Ye scholars, and ye lawyer crowds,<br />
Who are as gods reputed wise;<br />
Can ye from all the lore ye know,<br />
&rsquo;Gainst Death bestow some good advice?</p>
<p>The world, the flesh, and Devil, compose<br />
The direst foes of mortals poor;<br />
But take good heed of Death the Great,<br />
From the Lost Gate, Destruction o&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis not worth while of Death to prate,<br />
Of his Lost Gate and courts so wide;<br />
But O reflect! it much imports,<br />
Of the two courts in which ye&rsquo;re tried.</p>
<p>It here can little signify<br />
If the street high we cross, or low;<br />
Each lofty thought doth rise, be sure,<br />
The soul to lure to deepest woe.</p>
<p>But by the wall that&rsquo;s ne&rsquo;er re-pass&rsquo;d,<br

To gripe thee fast when Death prepares,<br />
Heed, heed thy steps, for thou mayst mourn<br />
The slightest turn for endless years.</p>
<p>When opes the door, and swiftly hence<br />
To its residence eternal flies<br />
The soul, it matters much, which side<br />
Of the gulf wide its journey lies.</p>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

A bosom rife of zeal and faith,<br />

Against the smart and sting of Death.</p>
<p>These things to thee seem worthless now,<br />
But not so low will they appear<br />
When thou art come, O thoughtless friend!<br />
Just to the end of thy career.</p>
<p>Thou&rsquo;lt deem, when thou hast done with earth,<br />
These things of worth unspeakable,<br />
Beside the gulf so black and drear,<br />
The gulf of Fear, &rsquo;twixt Heaven and Hell.</p>
<h2><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
69</span>A Vision of Hell.</h2>
<p>One fair morning of genial April, when the earth was green and
pregnant, and Britain, like a paradise, was wearing splendid 
liveries, tokens of the smile of the summer sun, I was walking 
upon the bank of the Severn, in the midst of the sweet notes of 
the little songsters of the wood, who appeared to be striving to 
break through all the measures of music, whilst pouring forth 
praise to the Creator.&nbsp; I too occasionally raised my voice, 
and warbled with the feathered choir, though in a manner somewhat
more restrained than that in which they sang; and occasionally 
read a portion of the book of the Practice of Godliness.&nbsp; 
Nevertheless, my former visions would not depart from my 
remembrance, but continually troubled me by coming across all 
other thoughts.&nbsp; And they persisted in doing so, until, by 
arguing the matter minutely with myself, I reflected that there 
is no vision but what comes from above, to warn one to be upon 
one&rsquo;s guard, and that consequently it was my duty to write 
mine <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>down, that they might serve as a warning to others 
also.&nbsp; I therefore returned to my home, and whilst 
overwhelmed with melancholy, I was endeavouring to collect some 
of my frightful reminiscences, I happened to give a yawn over my 
paper, and this gave master Sleep an opportunity to glide upon 
the top of me.&nbsp; Scarcely had Sleep closed my senses, when, 
behold! a glorious apparition came towards me, in the shape of a 
young man, tall and exceedingly beautiful; his garments were 
seven times more white than snow, his countenance was so lustrous
that it rendered the very sun obscure, and his curling locks of 
gold parted in two lovely wreaths upon his head, in the form of a
crown.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come with me, mortal man,&rdquo; said he on 
coming up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who art thou, my lord?&rdquo; said 
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the angel of the 
countries of the North, the guardian of Britain and its 
queen.&nbsp; I am one of the princes who are stationed beneath 
the throne of the Lamb, who receive commands for the protection 
of the gospel, against all its enemies in Hell and in Rome, in 
France and Constantinople, in Africa and in India, and 
wheresoever else they are devising artifices for its 
destruction.&nbsp; I am the angel who conducted thee below to 
castle Belial, and who showed thee the vanity and madness of the 
whole world, the city of Destruction, and the excellence of the 
city of Emmanuel, and I am come once more by his command, to show
thee other things, because thou art seeking to turn to account 
what thou hast seen already.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How, my 
lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;will your illustrious majesty, which 
superintends kings and kingdoms, condescend to associate with 
such a poor worm as myself?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O,&rdquo; said 
he, &ldquo;we respect more the virtue of a beggar than the 
grandeur of a sovereign.&nbsp; What if I be greater than the 
kings of the earth, and higher than many of the countless <!-- 
page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
71</span>potentates of heaven?&nbsp; As my wonderful master 
deigned to humble himself so inexpressibly as to wear one of your
bodies, and to live among you, and to die for your salvation, how
should I presume to be dissatisfied with my duty in serving you, 
and the vilest of the human race, since ye are so high in favour 
with my master?&nbsp; Come out, spirit, and free thyself from thy
clay,&rdquo; said he, with his eyes directed upwards.&nbsp; And 
with that word, I could feel myself becoming extricated from 
every part of my body.&nbsp; No sooner was I free, than he 
snatched me up to the firmament of heaven, through the region of 
lightning and thunder, and all the glowing armories of the sky, 
innumerable degrees higher than I had been with him before, 
whence I could scarcely descry the earth, which looked no wider 
than a croft.&nbsp; After permitting me to rest a short space, he
again lifted me up a million of miles, until I could see the sun 
far below us; we rushed through the milky way and past the 
Pleiades, and many other exceedingly large stars, till we caught 
a distant view of other worlds.&nbsp; At length, by dint of 
journeying, we reached the confines of the awful eternity, and 
were in sight of the two palaces of the mighty king Death, which 
stand one on the right hand and the other on the left, and are at
a great distance from each other, as there is an immense void 
between them.&nbsp; I enquired whether we should go to see the 
right hand palace, because it did not appear to me to resemble 
the other which I had seen before.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will probably
see,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;sometime, still more of the 
difference which is between the one palace and the other; but at 
present it is necessary for us to sail another 
course.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon we turned away from the little 
world, and having arrived over the intervening gap, we let 
ourselves down to the country of Eternity, between the two <!-- 
page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
72</span>palaces, into the horrible void; an enormous country it 
was, exceedingly deep and dark&mdash;without order and without 
inhabitants&mdash;now hot, now cold&mdash;sometimes silent, 
sometimes noisy, with the sound caused by cataracts of water 
tumbling upon the flames and extinguishing them; which cataracts,
however, did not long continue, for presently might be seen a 
puff of fire bursting out and consuming the water.&nbsp; There 
was here no course, nor whole, nothing living, nothing shapely; 
but a giddy discord and an amazing darkness which would have 
blinded me for ever, if my companion had not again displayed his 
heavenly garment of splendour.&nbsp; By the light which it cast I
could see the country of Oblivion, and the edges of the wilds of 
Destruction in front, on the left hand; and on the right the 
lowest skirts apparently of the walls of Glory.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Behold the great gulf between Abraham and Dives,&rdquo; 
said my guide, &ldquo;which is termed the place of Chaos.&nbsp; 
It is the region of the elements which God created first; it is 
the place wherein are the seeds of every living thing, from which
the Almighty word made your world and all that therein 
is&mdash;water, fire, air, earth, animals, fishes and creeping 
things, winged birds, and human bodies, but not your souls, for 
they are of an origin and generation higher and more 
exalted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Through the vast, frightful place of Chaos 
we at length broke out to the left hand, and before travelling 
any distance there, where every thing was ever becoming more 
frightful, I could feel my heart at the top of my throat, and my 
hair standing like the prickles of the hedge-hog, even before 
seeing any thing; but when I <i>did</i> see&mdash;oh! spectacle 
too much for tongue to relate, or for the spirit of man to 
behold.&nbsp; I fainted.&nbsp; Oh, the amazing and monstrous 
abyss, opening in a horrible manner into the other world!&nbsp; 
Oh, the <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>continual crackling of the terrible 
flames, darting over the sides of the accursed precipice, and the
flashes of linked lightning rending the black, thick smoke, which
the unsightly orifice was casting up!&nbsp; My dear companion, 
having brought me to myself again, gave me some spiritual water 
to drink; O how excellent it was in its taste and color!&nbsp; 
After drinking of the heavenly water, I could feel a wonderful 
strength diffusing itself through me, bringing with it sense, 
heart, faith, and various other heavenly virtues.&nbsp; By this 
time I had approached with him unterrified to the edge of the 
steep, enveloped in the veil, the flames parting on both sides 
and avoiding us, not daring to come in contact with the 
inhabitants of the supreme abodes.&nbsp; Then from the summit of 
the terrific precipice we darted down, like two stars falling 
from the firmament of heaven, a thousand million of miles, over 
many a brimstone crag, and many a furious, ugly cataract and 
glowing precipice, every thing that we passed looking always 
frowningly downward; yet every thing noxious avoided us, except 
once, when having thrust my nose out of the veil, I was struck by
such a suffocating, strangling exhalation as would have put an 
end to me, if my guide had not instantly assisted me with the 
water of life.&nbsp; By the time that I had recovered, I 
perceived that we had arrived at a kind of standing place; for in
all this loathsome chasm it was impossible to obtain any rest 
before, owing to the steepness and slipperiness of its 
sides.&nbsp; There my guide permitted me to take some further 
rest; and during this respite, it happened that the thunders and 
the hoarse whirlwinds became silent for a little while, and in 
spite of the din of the raging cataracts, I heard from afar a 
sound louder than the whole&mdash;a sound of horrible harsh 
voices, of shouting, bellowing, and strong groans, <!-- page 
74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
74</span>swearing, cursing, and blaspheming, till I would have 
consented to part with mine ears, that I might not hear.&nbsp; 
Ere we moved a foot farther, we could hear a terrible tumbling 
sound, and if we had not suddenly slipped aside, hundreds of 
unfortunate men would have fallen upon us, who were coming 
headlong, in excessive hurry, to take possession of their bad 
purchase, with a host of devils driving them.&nbsp; &ldquo;O, 
sir,&rdquo; said one devil, &ldquo;take it easy, lest you should 
ruffle your curling locks.&nbsp; Madam, do you wish for an easy 
cushion?&nbsp; I am afraid that you will be out of all order by 
the time you come to your couch,&rdquo; said he to another.</p>
<p>The strangers were exceedingly averse to going forward, 
insisting that they were out of their road; but notwithstanding 
all they could say, go they did, and we behind them, to a black 
flood of great magnitude, and through it they went, and we across
it, my companion holding the celestial water continually to my 
nostrils, to strengthen me against the stench of the river, and 
against the time when I should see some of the inhabitants of the
place, for hitherto I had not beheld so much as one devil, though
I had heard the voices of many.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, my 
lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what is the name of this putrid 
river?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The river of the Fiend,&rdquo; said 
he, &ldquo;in which all his subjects are bathed, in order that 
they may be rendered fit for the country.&nbsp; For this accursed
water changes their countenance, and washes away from them every 
relic of goodness, every semblance of hope and of 
comfort.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, indeed, on gazing upon the host after 
it had come through, I could distinguish no difference in 
deformity between the devils and the damned.&nbsp; Some of the 
latter would fain have sculked at the bottom of the river, and 
have lain there to all eternity, in a state of strangulation, 
lest they should get a worse bed father <!-- page 75--><a 
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>on; but here 
the proverb was verified, that &ldquo;he must needs run whom the 
Devil drives,&rdquo; for with the devils behind, the damned were 
compelled to go forward unto the beach, to their eternal 
damnation; where I at the first glance saw more pains and 
torments than the heart of man can imagine or the tongue relate; 
a single one of which was sufficient to make the hair stand 
erect, the blood to freeze, the flesh to melt, the bones to drop 
from their places&mdash;yea, the spirit to faint.&nbsp; What is 
empaling or sawing men alive, tearing off the flesh piecemeal 
with iron pincers, or broiling the flesh with candles, collop 
fashion, or squeezing heads flat in a vice, and all the most 
shocking devices which ever were upon earth, compared with one of
these?&nbsp; Mere pastime!&nbsp; Here were a hundred thousand 
shoutings, hoarse sighs, and strong groans; yonder a boisterous 
wailing and horrible outcry answering them, and the howling of a 
dog is sweet, delicious music, when compared with these 
sounds.&nbsp; When we had proceeded a little way onward from the 
accursed beach, towards the wild place of Damnation, I perceived,
by their own light, innumerable men and women here and there; and
devils without number and without rest, incessantly employing 
their strength in tormenting.&nbsp; Yes, there they were, devils 
and damned, the devils roaring with their own torments, and 
making the damned roar, by means of the torments which they 
inflicted upon them.&nbsp; I paid particular observation to the 
corner which was nearest me.&nbsp; There I beheld the devils with
pitch-forks, tossing the damned up into the air, that they might 
fall headlong on poisoned hatchels or barbed pikes, there to 
wriggle their bowels out.&nbsp; After a time the wretches would 
crawl in multitudes, one upon another, to the top of one of the 
burning crags, there to be broiled like mutton; from there <!-- 
page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
76</span>they would be snatched afar, to the top of one of the 
mountains of eternal frost and snow, where they would be allowed 
to shiver for a time; thence they would be precipitated into a 
loathsome pool of boiling brimstone, to wallow there in 
conflagration, smoke, and the suffocation of horrible stench; 
from the pool they would be driven to the marsh of Hell that they
might embrace and be embraced by its reptiles many times worse 
than serpents and vipers; after allowing them half an 
hour&rsquo;s dalliance with these creatures, the devils would 
seize a bundle of rods of steel, fiery hot from the furnace, and 
would scourge them till their howlings, caused by the horrible 
inexpressible pain which they endured, would fill the vast abode 
of darkness, and when the fiends deemed that they had scourged 
them enough, they would take hot irons and sear their bloody 
wounds.</p>
<p>There was here no fainting, nor swooning to evade a moment of 
suffering, but a continual strength to suffer and to feel, though
you would have imagined after one horrible cry, that it would be 
utterly impossible there should be strength remaining to give 
another cry so frightfully loud; the damned never lowered their 
key, and the devils kept replying, &ldquo;behold your welcome for
ever and ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it almost seemed that the 
sauciness and bitterness of the devils, in jeering and mocking 
their victims, were worse to bear than the pain itself.&nbsp; 
What was worst of all, their conscience was at present utterly 
aroused, and was tearing them worse than a thousand of the 
infernal lions.&nbsp; We proceeded farther and farther downward, 
and the farther we proceeded, the more horrible was the work 
which was going on; the first place we came to in our progress 
was a frightful prison, in which were many human beings under the
scourge of the devils, shrieking most <!-- page 77--><a 
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
77</span>shockingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What place is this?&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the angel, &ldquo;is the couch 
of those who cry &lsquo;woe is me that I did 
not&mdash;!&rsquo;&nbsp; Hark to them for a moment!&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Woe is me that I did not purify myself in time from every 
kind of sin!&rdquo; says one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Woe is me that I did 
not believe and repent before coming here!&rdquo; says the 
other.</p>
<p>Next to the cell of too late repentance, and of debate after 
judgment had been passed, was the prison of the procrastinators, 
who would be every time promising amendment, without ever 
fulfilling their promise.&nbsp; &ldquo;When this business is 
over,&rdquo; says one, &ldquo;I will turn over another 
leaf.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;When this obstacle is removed, I will 
become a new man yet,&rdquo; says the other.&nbsp; But when the 
obstacle is removed, they are not a bit the nearer to 
reformation, for some other obstacle is always found to prevent 
them from moving towards the gate of Righteousness, and if they 
do sometimes move a little, they are sure to turn back.&nbsp; 
Next to this was the prison of vain confidence, full of those 
who, on being commanded to abstain from their luxuriousness, 
drunkenness, or avarice, would say, &ldquo;God is merciful, and 
better than his word, and will not damn his creature for ever for
so small a matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; But here they were yelping forth 
blasphemy, and asking where is that mercy, which was boasted to 
be immeasurable.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peace, hell-dogs,&rdquo; at length 
said a great lobster of a devil who was hearing them, 
&ldquo;peace! would you have mercy without doing any thing to 
obtain it?&nbsp; Would you have the Truth render his word false, 
for the sake of obtaining the company of such filthy dross as 
you?&nbsp; Too much mercy has been shown to you already.&nbsp; 
You were given a Saviour, a comforter, and the apostles, with 
books, sermons, and good examples, and will you never cease to 
deafen us with bawling about mercy, where <!-- page 78--><a 
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>mercy has 
never been?&rdquo;&nbsp; On going out from this fiery gulf, I 
could hear one puffing and shouting terribly, &ldquo;I knew no 
better, nothing was ever expended in teaching me my duty, and I 
could never find time to read or pray, because I was obliged to 
earn bread for myself and my poor family.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said a little crooked devil who stood by, 
&ldquo;and did you never find time to tell pleasant 
stories?&mdash;no leisure for self vaunting during long winter 
evenings when I was in the chimney corner?&nbsp; Now, why did you
not devote some of that time to learning to read and pray?&nbsp; 
Who on Sundays used to come with me to the tavern, instead of 
going with the parson to church?&nbsp; Who devoted many a Sunday 
afternoon to vain prating about worldly things, or to sleep, 
instead of meditation and prayer?&nbsp; And have ye merely acted 
according to your knowledge and your opportunities?&nbsp; Peace, 
sirrah, with your lying nonsense!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O thou 
blood of a mad dog!&rdquo; said the lost man, &ldquo;it is not 
long since you were whispering something very different into my 
ear, if you had said that the other day, I should scarcely have 
come here.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O,&rdquo; said the devil, 
&ldquo;we do not mind telling you the bitter truth here, since we
need not fear that you will go back to tell tales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Below this cell I saw a kind of vast pit, and in it what 
looked like an infinite quantity of loathsome ordure, burning 
with a green flame, and on drawing near, I was aware, from the 
horrid howling that proceeded from it, that it was composed of 
men piled one upon another, the horrible flames crackling 
meanwhile through them.&nbsp; &ldquo;This hollow,&rdquo; said the
angel, &ldquo;is the couch of those who say after committing some
great sin, &lsquo;pooh!&nbsp; I am not the first, I have plenty 
of companions;&rsquo; and thus you see, they <i>do</i> get plenty
of companions, to verify their words and to increase their 
agony.&rdquo;&nbsp; Opposite <!-- page 79--><a 
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>to this 
horrible place was a large cellar, where I could see men twisted,
as tow is twisted, or hemp is spun.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; 
said I &ldquo;who are these?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Panegyrists,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and out of sheer 
mockery to them, the devils are trying whether it is possible to 
twist them as flexibly as they twisted their own 
discourse.&rdquo;&nbsp; A little way below that cell, I could but
just descry a sort of prison-pool, very dark, and in it things 
which had been men, having faces like the heads of wolf-dogs, and
up to their jaws in bog, barking blasphemy and lies most 
furiously, as long as they could get their sting above the 
mud.&nbsp; At this moment a troop of devils happening to pass by,
some of these creatures contrived to bite in the heels, ten or 
twelve of the devils who had brought them thither.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Woe and destruction to you hell-dogs!&rdquo; said one of 
the devils who had been bit, &ldquo;you shall pay for 
this;&rdquo; and forthwith commenced beating the bog, till the 
wretches were drowned in the stinking abysses.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Who,&rdquo; he then added, &ldquo;have deserved hell 
better than you, who have been hunting up and devising gossip, 
and buzzing lies about from house to house, in order that you 
might laugh, after having set a whole country at 
loggerheads.&nbsp; What more could one of ourselves have 
done?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the angel, &ldquo;is 
the bed of the tale-bearers, the slanderers, and the whisperers, 
and of all other envious curs, who are continually wounding 
people behind their backs with their hands or their 
tongues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From here we passed to a vast dungeon, by far the filthiest 
that I had seen yet, and the most replete with toads, adders, and
stench.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said my guide, &ldquo;is the 
place of the men who expect to get to heaven because they have no
ill intentions, that is, for being neither good nor 
bad.&rdquo;&nbsp; Next to this pool of ill savour, I beheld a 
place where a vast crowd <!-- page 80--><a 
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>were sitting,
and without any thing visible to torment them, groaning more 
piteously than any that I had hitherto heard in Hell.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Mercy upon us,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what causes these 
people to complain more than the rest, when they have neither 
torture nor devil near them?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O,&rdquo; said 
the angel, &ldquo;the less torment they have without, the more 
they have within.&nbsp; These are refractory heretics, atheists, 
antichristians, worldly-wise ones, abjurers of the faith, 
persecutors of the church, and an infinity of such like wretches,
who are abandoned entirely to the punishment of conscience, more 
tormenting than flame or devil, which domineers over them 
ceaselessly and without restraint.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will never 
permit myself any more,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;to be drowned in 
ale, nor to be blinded by bribes, nor deafened by music and 
company, nor lulled nor confounded by careless listlessness; for 
now I <i>will</i> be listened to, and never shall the clack of 
the hated truth cease in your ears.&rsquo;&nbsp; Longing is ever 
raging within the wretch for the happiness which he has lost; 
memory is ever reproaching him by saying how easy it was to be 
obtained, and the understanding showing him the magnitude of his 
loss, and the certainty that nothing is now to be obtained, but 
indescribable gnawing for ever and ever.&nbsp; So with these 
three instruments&mdash;namely longing, memory, and 
understanding&mdash;conscience is tearing the lost one, in a 
manner far worse than all the devils in Hell could tear him with 
their claws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On coming out of this wonderful nook I heard a confused 
talking, and after every word such a ghastly laughter, as if five
hundred devils were casting their horns with laughing.&nbsp; On 
approaching to see the cause of such a rarity as laughter in 
Hell, I discovered that it was only got up to incense two 
honorable gentlemen, newly arrived, who were insisting on <!-- 
page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
81</span>being shown respect suitable to their gentility.&nbsp; 
One of them was a round bodied squire, having with him a big roll
of parchment&mdash;namely his map of pedigree&mdash;out of which 
he recited from which of the fifty tribes of North Wales he was 
sprung, and how many justices of the peace, and how many sheriffs
his house had produced.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said one 
of the devils, &ldquo;we know the merits of the greater part of 
your ancestry.&nbsp; If you had been like your father or your 
great grandfather, we should not have ventured to come in contact
with you; but you are only the heir of the pit of darkness, you 
dirty hell-dog!&nbsp; You are scarcely worthy of a night&rsquo;s 
lodging,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;and yet we&rsquo;ll grant you 
some nook, wherein to await the dawn;&rdquo; and with that word 
the goblin with his pitchfork, gave him more than thirty tosses 
in the fiery air, until he at length cast him into an abyss out 
of sight.&nbsp; &ldquo;That may do,&rdquo; said the other, 
&ldquo;for a squire of half blood, but I hope you will behave 
better to a knight, who has had the honor of serving the king in 
person, and can name twelve earls and fifty baronets belonging to
his ancient house.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If your ancestors and your
ancient house be all that you can bring in your defence, you may 
go the same road as he,&rdquo; said one of the devils, 
&ldquo;because we can scarcely remember one ancient house, of 
which some oppressor, murderer, or strong thief did not lay the 
foundation, and which he did not transmit to people as froward as
himself, or to lazy drones, or drunken swine, to maintain whose 
extravagant magnificence, the vassals and the tenantry must be 
squeezed to death, whilst every handsome colt or pretty cow in 
the neighbourhood must be parted with for the pleasure of the 
mistress, and every lass or married woman, may consider herself 
fortunate, if she escape the pleasure of the master; the 
freeholders, meanwhile, being <!-- page 82--><a 
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>either 
obliged to follow him like fawning hounds, rob themselves for his
benefit, and sell their patrimonies at his pleasure, or be 
subject to frowns and hatred, and be dragged into every 
disagreeable and vexatious employment during their lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O these little great country folks,&rdquo; continued 
the devil, &ldquo;how genteely they swear in order to obtain 
credit with their mistresses, or with the shop-keepers; and when 
they have decked themselves out, O how insolently they look upon 
many of the middling officers of the church and state, and how 
much worse on the common people! as if they were a species of 
reptiles in comparison with themselves.&nbsp; Woe is me! is not 
all blood of the same color?&nbsp; Did you not come all into the 
world by the same way?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But, nevertheless, 
with your permission,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;there are 
some who are of much purer birth than others.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Destruction take you!&rdquo; said the goblin, &ldquo;there
is not one carcass of you all better than the rest; you are all 
polluted with radical sin from Adam.&nbsp; But, sir,&rdquo; said 
he, &ldquo;if your blood be better than other blood, less scum 
will exude from you when boiling; however, in order to be sure of
its quality, it will be as well to search you with fire as well 
as water.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon a devil in the shape of a 
chariot of fire received him, and the other in mockery lifted him
into it, and away he was hurried like lightning.&nbsp; After a 
short time the angel caused me to look, and I could see the 
wretched knight suffering a terrible steeping in a frightful 
boiling furnace, in company with Cain, Nimrod, Esau, Tarquin, 
Nero, Caligula, and the others who were the founders of 
genealogies, and were the first to set up arms of nobility.</p>
<p>A little farther on, my guide caused me to look through the 
hollow of a rock, and there I beheld a number of coquettes <!-- 
page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
83</span>briskly at work, doing and repeating all their former 
follies upon earth.&nbsp; Some were twisting their mouths, some 
were pulling their front locks with irons, some were painting 
themselves, some patching their faces with sooty ointments, to 
make the yellow look more fair; some quite mad at seeing their 
visages, after all their pains in coloring and variegating, more 
hideous than those of the very devils, were endeavouring to break
the mirrors, or were tearing off with their nails and their teeth
the whole artificial blush&mdash;the ointments, skin, and flesh 
coming off all together.&nbsp; The cries which they uttered 
occasionally were most dismal.&nbsp; &ldquo;The curse of 
curses,&rdquo; would one say, &ldquo;on my father, for making me 
marry when a girl, an old sapless stump, whose work in raising 
desires which he could not gratify has driven me 
hither.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A thousand curses on my 
parents,&rdquo; would another say, &ldquo;for sending me to a 
cloister to learn chastity; they would not have done worse in 
sending me to a roundhead to learn generosity, or to a quaker to 
learn manners, than to a papist to learn honor.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Destruction,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;seize my mother 
for her avaricious pride in preventing my obtaining a husband 
when I wanted one, and thus obliging me to purloin the thing I 
might have honorably come by.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hell, and 
double Hell to the lustful wretch of a gentleman, who first began
tempting me,&rdquo; would the third say; &ldquo;if he had not, 
betwixt fair and foul, broken the hedge, I had not become a cell 
open to every body, nor had I come to this cell of 
devils!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then they fell to tearing themselves 
again.</p>
<p>I was glad to quit such a pack of female dogs.&nbsp; But 
before I had passed on many steps, I was surprised to see another
shoal of imprisoned wenches, twice more detestable than 
they.&nbsp; Some had been changed into toads, some into <!-- page
84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
84</span>dragons, some into serpents who were swimming and 
hissing, glavering and butting in a fetid, stagnant pool, much 
larger than Llyn Tegid. <a name="citation84"></a><a 
href="#footnote84" class="citation">[84]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;In the 
name of wonder,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what sort of creatures may 
these be?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There are here,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;four sorts of wenches, all notoriously bad.&nbsp; First, 
there are procuresses, with some of the principal lasses of their
respective bevies about them.&nbsp; Second, gossiping ladies with
a swarm of their news-bearing hags.&nbsp; Third, bouncing madams,
and a pack of sneaking curs on both sides of them, for no man, 
but for downright fear of them, would ever go nigh them.&nbsp; 
Fourth, scolds, become a hundred times more horrible than vipers,
with their poisonous stings going creak, creak to all 
eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had imagined that Lucifer had been a king of too much
courtesy, to put a gentlewoman of my rank with such little petty 
she-devils as these,&rdquo; said one, something like a winged 
serpent, only that she was much more fierce.&nbsp; &ldquo;O that 
he would send here, seven hundred of the worst devils in Hell in 
exchange for thee, thou poisonous hell-spawn!&rdquo; said another
ugly viper.&nbsp; &ldquo;O! many thanks to you,&rdquo; said a 
gigantic devil who overheard them, &ldquo;we set too much value 
on our place and merits, to condescend to become mates of yours; 
and though we are willing to admit that you are fully as 
competent to torment people as the best of us, we would, 
nevertheless, not yield up our duties to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said the angel softly, &ldquo;Lucifer has 
another reason for keeping such a particular watch over these; he
knows well, that if they should break out, they would turn all 
Hell topsy-turvy.&rdquo;&nbsp; From here we went, still going 
downward, to a place where I beheld a frightful den, in which was
a horrible clamour, the like of <!-- page 85--><a 
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>which I had 
never heard, for swearing, cursing, blaspheming, snarling, 
groaning, and crying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is here?&rdquo; said 
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the den of the 
thieves.&nbsp; Here is a swarm of game-keepers, lawyers, 
stewards, and the old Judas in the midst of them; they have been 
excessively annoyed at seeing the tailors and weavers above them,
in a more comfortable chamber.&rdquo;&nbsp; Almost before I could
turn myself, there came a horse of a devil, bearing a physician 
and an apothecary, whom he cast down amongst the pedlars and the 
duffers, for selling bad, rotten ware; but they beginning to fume
at being placed in such low company, one of the devils said, 
&ldquo;stay, stay! you <i>do</i> deserve a different 
place,&rdquo; and cast them down amongst the conquerors and the 
murderers.&nbsp; There was a multitude shut up here, for playing 
with false dice and concealing cards; but before I could observe 
much, I heard, close by the door, a terrible rush and rustle, 
with a hie! hie! get on! ho! yo! hip!&nbsp; I turned to see what 
it was; but perceiving nothing but horned goblins, I enquired of 
my guide whether there were cuckolds amongst the devils?&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they are in a particular 
cell.&nbsp; These are drovers who would fain escape to the place 
of the Sabbath-breakers, and are driven hither against their 
will.&rdquo;&nbsp; At that word, I looked, and perceived their 
polls full of the horns of sheep and cattle, and those who drove 
them, casting them down beneath the feet of the bloodiest 
robbers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Crouch there,&rdquo; said one; 
&ldquo;though you feared so much of old the thieves on London 
road, you were yourselves the very worst species of highwaymen, 
living upon the road and plundering, yes, and murdering poor 
families.&nbsp; O how many poor creatures did you not keep, with 
their hungry mouths open, in vain expectation of the money for 
the sale of the beasts, which they had intrusted to you; and you 
in the <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>mean time in Ireland, or in the 
King&rsquo;s Bench laughing at them, or upon the road in the 
midst of your wine and harlots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On quitting this den of furious heat, I got a sight of a lair,
exceeding all the rest I had seen in Hell, but one, in frightful 
stinking filthiness, where was a herd of accursed drunken swine, 
disgorging and swallowing, swallowing and disgorging, continually
and without rest, the most loathsome snivel.&nbsp; The next pit 
was the couch of gluttony, where Dives and his companions were 
upon their bellies, eating dirt and fire alternately, without any
liquid ever.&nbsp; A cave or two lower there was an exceedingly 
spacious kitchen, in which some were in a state of roasting and 
boiling, others frying and burning in an oven half heated.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Behold the place of the merciless and the 
unfeeling,&rdquo; said the angel.&nbsp; I then turned a little to
the left hand, where there was a cell more light than any one 
which I had yet seen in Hell, and enquired what place it 
was?&nbsp; &ldquo;The abode of the infernal dragons,&rdquo; 
replied the angel, &ldquo;who are hissing and snarling, rushing 
and preying upon one another every minute.&rdquo;&nbsp; I 
approached; and oh! the look which cannot be described was upon 
them, the whole light was but the living fire in their 
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;These are the seed of Adam,&rdquo; said my 
guide, &ldquo;morose wretches, and furious savage men; but, 
yonder,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are some of the old seed of the 
great dragon Lucifer;&rdquo; and verily, I could perceive not a 
whit more amiability in the one sort than in the other.&nbsp; In 
the next cellar were the misers, in a state of horrible agony 
with their hearts cleaving to coffers of burning treasure, the 
rust whereof was ceaselessly cankering them, because those hearts
had been ceaselessly bent upon getting money&mdash;O the 
consuming torment, worse than frenzy, that was now going on 
within them, with care and repentance.&nbsp; Below this there 
<!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
87</span>was a hanging ledge, where there were some apothecaries 
ground to dust, and stuffed into earthen pots amongst album 
grecum, dung of geese and swine, and many an old stinking 
ointment.</p>
<p>We were now journeying forward, continually descending, along 
the wilderness of Destruction, through innumerable torments, 
eternal and not to be described&mdash;from cell to cell, from 
cellar to cellar, and the last always surpassing the others in 
horror and ghastliness; at last we arrived at a vast porch, more 
cheerless than any thing we had seen before.&nbsp; It was a very 
spacious porch, and the pathway through it, which was frightfully
steep, led to a kind of dusky nook of incredible ugliness and 
horror, and there the palace was.&nbsp; At the upper end of the 
accursed court, among thousands of horrible objects, I could, by 
means of the radiance of my heavenly companion, perceive amidst 
the dreary darkness two feet of enormous magnitude, reaching to 
the roof of the whole infernal firmament.&nbsp; I enquired of my 
conductor what this horrible thing might be?&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Patience,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you shall obtain a more 
ample view of this monster as you return; but move forward now to
see the royal palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst we were proceeding down the porch of Horror, we heard a
noise behind us, as of an immense number of people.&nbsp; Having 
turned aside to let them pass forward, we beheld four distinct 
bands, and soon discovered that the four princesses of the city 
of Destruction, were bringing their subjects as presents to their
father.&nbsp; I recognised the princess Pride, not only by her 
being before the others, but also by her habit of stumbling every
moment, for want of looking beneath her feet.&nbsp; She had with 
her a vast many kings, potentates, <!-- page 88--><a 
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>courtiers, 
gentlemen, and pompous people, many quakers, innumerable females 
of every rank and degree.</p>
<p>The princess Lucre was next, with her silly, mean figure, 
bringing along with her very many of the money loving 
race&mdash;such as usurers, lawyers, extortioners, overseers, 
game-keepers, harlots, and some ecclesiastics also.&nbsp; Next to
these was the amiable princess Pleasure and her daughter Folly, 
conducting their subjects&mdash;consisting of players at dice, 
cards, draughts, games of legerdemain, and of poets, musicians, 
tellers of old stories, drunkards, ladies of pleasure, debauches,
pretty fellows, with a thousand million of all kinds of baubles, 
to serve now as instruments of punishment for the lost 
fools.&nbsp; After these three had gone with their prisoners to 
the palace, to receive their judgment&mdash;behold Hypocrisy, the
last of all, conducting a more numerous rout than any of the 
others, of all nations and ages, of town and country, gentle and 
simple, males and females.&nbsp; At the tail of the two-faced 
multitudes we advanced till we came in sight of the palace, 
through many dragons and horned sprites, and warriors of Hell, 
the black wardens of the gloomy pandemonium, I all the time 
crouching very carefully within my veil.&nbsp; We entered the 
frightful and awful edifice, every corner of which abounded with 
horror.&nbsp; The walls were immense rocks of glowing adamant, 
the pavement of an insufferably sharp flint, the roof of burning 
steel, meeting like an arch of greenish-blue and dusky-red 
flames, and in its size and its heat, resembling an immense 
vaulted baking oven.</p>
<p>Opposite to the door, on a flaming throne, the Arch-Fiend was 
seated, his principal lost angels on both sides of him, on 
thrones of fire terrible to behold&mdash;sitting according to 
their former rank in the regions of light, when they were <!-- 
page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
89</span>amiable messengers.&nbsp; It would only be in vain to 
endeavour to relate how obscene and horrible they were; and the 
longer I looked at any one of them, seven times more hideous he 
appeared.&nbsp; In the midst, above the head of Lucifer, was a 
vast fist, holding a very frightful bolt.&nbsp; The princesses, 
after making their obeisance, returned to the world to their 
charges, without making any stay.&nbsp; As soon as they had 
departed, a gigantic, wide-mouthed devil, by command of the king,
uttered a shout louder than a hundred discharges of artillery, as
loud if possible as the last trumpet, for the purpose of 
summoning the infernal parliament.&nbsp; And lo! the rabble of 
Hell instantly filled the palace and the porch in every shape, 
after the image and similitude of the principal sin, which each 
delighted to thrust upon mankind.&nbsp; After commanding silence,
Lucifer, with his look directed to the potentates nearest to him,
began to speak, very graciously, in the following 
manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye potentates of Hell! princes of the black abodes of 
Despair!&nbsp; Though by our confederacy we have lost possession 
of those thrones, from which we once shone resplendent through 
the higher regions; our confederacy was, nevertheless, a glorious
one, as we aimed at nothing less than the whole.&nbsp; And we 
have not lost the whole either; for lo! the extensive and 
profound regions, to the extremest wilds of vast Destruction, are
yet beneath our sway.&nbsp; It is true we reign in horrible 
agony; but spirits of our eminence prefer ruling in torment to 
serving in ease.&nbsp; And besides this, we are on the eve of 
obtaining another world, more than three parts of the earth 
having been beneath my banner for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And although the Almighty Enemy, sent his own son to 
die for the beings of that world; yet I, by my baubles, <!-- page
90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
90</span>obtain ten souls, for every one which he obtains by his 
crucified son.&nbsp; And although I have not been able to reach 
him, who sits in the high places and discharges the invincible 
thunderbolts, yet revenge of some kind is sweet.&nbsp; Let us 
complete the destruction of the remnant of human beings, still in
the favour of our destroyer.&nbsp; I remember the time, when you 
caused them to be burnt by multitudes and cities, and even the 
whole race of the earth, by means of the flood, to be swept down 
to us in the fire.&nbsp; But at present, though your strength and
your natural cruelty are not a whit diminished, yet you are 
become in some degree inactive; if that had not been the case, we
might long since have destroyed the few who are godly, and have 
caused the earth to be united with this our vast empire.&nbsp; 
But know, ye black ministers of my displeasure, that unless ye be
more resolute and more diligent, and make the most of the short 
time which yet remains to you for doing evil, ye shall experience
the weight of my anger, in torments new and strange to the oldest
of you.&nbsp; This I swear by the deepest Hell, and the vast, 
eternal pit of Darkness.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, thereupon, he frowned,
till the palace became seven times more gloomy than before.</p>
<p>Moloch now arose, one of the infernal potentates, and after 
making his obeisance to the king, he said, &ldquo;O emperor of 
the Air! mighty ruler of Darkness! no one ever doubted my 
propensity to malice and cruelty; the sufferings of others have 
been, and still are, my supreme delight.&nbsp; It is as capital 
sport to me, to hear the shrieks of infants perishing in the fire
as of old, when thousands of sucklings were sacrificed to me 
outside of Jerusalem.&nbsp; When was I ever slack at my 
work?&nbsp; Since the return of the crucified Enemy to the 
supreme abodes, I have employed myself in slaying and burning his
subjects.&nbsp; <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>I did all I could, to destroy the 
Christians from the face of the earth, during the reigns of ten 
emperors; and many an awful butchery I have made of them in 
modern times, both in Paris and England, to say nothing of other 
places: but what are we the nearer to our object for all 
this?&nbsp; The One above has caused the tree to grow, after its 
branches have been severed; and all our efforts, are nothing 
better than showing one&rsquo;s teeth, without the power of 
biting.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Lucifer, &ldquo;a 
fig for such heartless legions as ye.&nbsp; I will no longer rely
upon you!&nbsp; I will do the work myself, and the glory thereof 
I will share with no one.&nbsp; I will go to the earth in my own 
kingly person, and will swallow up the whole; not one man, 
henceforth, shall be found on the earth to adore the 
Almighty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he gave a furious bound, 
attempting to set off, in a firmament of living fire; but, 
behold! the fist above his head shook the terrific bolt till he 
trembled in the midst of his frenzy, and before he could move 
far, an invisible hand lugged the old fox back by his chain, in 
spite of his teeth.&nbsp; Whereupon he became seven times more 
frantic; his eyes were more terrible than lightnings, black thick
smoke burst from his nostrils, and dark green flames from his 
mouth and entrails: he gnawed his chain in his agony, and hissed 
forth direful blasphemy, and the most frightful curses.</p>
<p>But perceiving how vain it was to seek to break loose, or to 
struggle with the Almighty, he returned to his place and 
proceeded with his discourse somewhat more calmly, but with ten 
times more malice.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Omnipotent Thunderer has 
vanquished me, and he alone could have done so.&nbsp; To him I 
submit.&nbsp; Against him all my fury is in vain; I will, 
therefore, direct it against nearer and lower objects, and pour 
it in showers upon those who are yet under my banner, and within 
<!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
92</span>the reach of my chain.&nbsp; Arise, ye ministers of 
Destruction! rulers of the unquenchable fire! and as my wrath and
my venom flow forth and my malice boileth out, do ye assiduously 
spread the whole tide amongst the damned, particularly the 
Christians.&nbsp; Urge the instruments of torture to the 
utmost&mdash;devise as many more as you can&mdash;double the fire
and the boiling, until the very cauldrons be overturned; and when
they are in the most extreme, inexpressible torture, mock, 
deride, and upbraid them; and when your whole stock of ironry and
bitterness is expended, hasten to me, and you shall obtain 
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There had been for some time a comparative silence in Hell, 
and the more cruel tortures had been suspended; but now the 
stillness which Lucifer had caused was broken, when the ghastly 
butchers rushed like wild hungry bears upon their 
prisoners.&nbsp; O then there arose an oh! oh! oh! a wail, and 
universal howling, more loud than the sound of cataracts, or the 
tumult of an earthquake, so that Hell became seven times more 
frightful.&nbsp; I should have swooned if my dear companion had 
not rendered me assistance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take now,&rdquo; said 
he, &ldquo;plenty of the water, that you may obtain strength to 
see things yet more horrible than these.&rdquo;&nbsp; But 
scarcely had these words proceeded from his mouth, when, lo! the 
celestial Justice, who sits above the precipice keeping the gate 
of Hell, came scourging three men with a rod of fiery 
scorpions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; said Lucifer, &ldquo;here 
are three right reverend gentlemen, whom Justice himself has 
deigned to conduct to my kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! woe is 
me,&rdquo; said one of the three, &ldquo;who asked him to trouble
himself?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Be it known,&rdquo; said Justice, 
with a glance which made the devils tremble till they knocked one
against another, &ldquo;that it is the will of the Great Creator,
<!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
93</span>that I should myself bring these three accursed 
murderers to their home.&nbsp; Sirrah,&rdquo; said he to one of 
the devils, &ldquo;unbolt for me the prison of the murderers, 
where are Cain and Nero, Bonner, Bradshaw, Ignatius, and 
innumerable others of a similar description.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Alas, alas! we never killed any body,&rdquo; said one of 
the prisoners.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, because you did not get time and 
because you were prevented,&rdquo; said Justice.&nbsp; When the 
den was opened, there came out such a horrible puff of bloody 
flame, and such a yell as if a thousand dragons were giving their
last gasp in their death agony.&nbsp; Into this den Justice 
hurled his prisoners; <a name="citation93"></a><a 
href="#footnote93" class="citation">[93]</a> and on his way back 
he breathed obliquely, such a tempest of fiery whirlwinds upon 
the Arch-Fiend and all his potentates, as he passed by them, that
Lucifer, Beelzebub, Satan, Moloch, Abaddon, Asmodeus, Dagon, 
Apollyon, Belphegor, Mephistophiles, and all the other principal 
demons were whisked away, and tumbled headlong into a kind of 
gulf, which was opening and closing in the midst of the palace, 
and whose aspect was more horrible, and whose steam was more 
frightful than the aspect and vapour of any gulf which I had 
previously seen.&nbsp; Before I could enquire of the angel as to 
what it was, he said, &ldquo;that is a hole which leads to 
another vast world.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;what is the name of that world?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is 
called,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Unknown, or extremest Hell, the 
habitation of the devils, and the place to which they are at 
present gone.&nbsp; The vast wilderness, over part of which you 
have come, is called the country of Despair, a place intended for
the lost until the Day of Judgment, when it will fall into 
extremest, bottomless Hell, and the two will become one.&nbsp; 
When that has happened <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>one of ourselves will come and close 
the gate of the whole region of horror upon the devils and the 
damned, which gate shall never, to all eternity, be opened for 
them.&nbsp; In the meantime, however, permission is given to the 
devils to come to these cooler regions, in order to torment the 
lost souls.&nbsp; Yea, they often obtain permission to go even 
into the air, and about the earth, to tempt men to the 
destructive paths, which lead to this dismal prison, from which 
there is no escape.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the midst of this history, 
and whilst I was in great surprise at seeing the mouth of 
Unknown, so much surpassing in horror the jaws of upper Hell, I 
could hear a prodigious noise of arms, and loud discharges from 
one side, answered by what seemed to be hoarse thunders from the 
other; the rocks of Death, meanwhile, rebellowing the tumult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the sound of war,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Is there war then in Hell?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There 
is,&rdquo; said the angel; &ldquo;and it is impossible that there
should not be here continual war.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whilst we were 
moving out, to see what was the matter, I beheld the mouth of 
Unknown opening, and casting up thousands of candles, burning 
with a frightful green flame.&nbsp; These were Lucifer and his 
potentates, who had contrived to subdue the tempest.&nbsp; But 
when the Arch Fiend heard the noise of war, he became more pale 
than Death, and began to call and gather together bands of his 
old experienced soldiers to quell the tumult.&nbsp; At this 
moment he stumbled against a little puppy of an imp, who had 
escaped between the feet of the combatants.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is 
the matter?&rdquo; said the king.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such a matter as 
will endanger your crown, unless you look to yourself,&rdquo; 
said the imp.&nbsp; Close behind him came another fiendish 
courier, bawling hoarsely, &ldquo;you are plotting disquiet for 
others, look now to your own repose.&nbsp; Yonder are the <!-- 
page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
95</span>Turks, the Papists, and the bloody-handed Roundheads, in
three bands, filling all the plains of the dark abodes, 
committing terrible outrages, and turning every thing 
topsy-turvy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How came they out?&rdquo; said 
the Arch Fiend, looking worse than Demigorgon.&nbsp; &ldquo;The 
Papists,&rdquo; said the messenger, &ldquo;broke out of their 
Purgatory, I do not know how; and then on account of an old 
grudge, they went to attack the back gate of the Paradise of 
Mahomet, and let all the Turks out of their prison; and 
afterwards, in the hubbub, the seed of Cromwell found some means 
to break out of their cells.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Lucifer turned 
about and looked under his throne, where were all the lost kings,
and caused Cromwell to be kept close in his kennel; and likewise 
all the emperors of the Turks, under watch and ward.&nbsp; He 
then hastened with his legions along the black wilds of Darkness,
each obtaining light from the fire which was incessantly 
tormenting his body.&nbsp; Guided by the horrid uproar, the 
fiends advanced courageously towards the combatants; then silence
was enjoined in the name of the king, and Lucifer enquired, 
&ldquo;what is the cause of this disturbance in my 
kingdom?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Please, your infernal 
majesty,&rdquo; said Mahomet, &ldquo;a dispute arose between me 
and pope Leo, as to whether my Koran or the creed of Rome, had 
rendered you most service; and whilst we were at it, a pack of 
Roundheads broke their prison and put in their oar; asserting 
that their league and covenant, deserved more respect at your 
hands than either.&nbsp; Thus from disputing we have come to 
blows, and from words to arms.&nbsp; But at present, as your 
majesty has returned from Unknown, I will refer the matter to 
yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay, we shall not let you escape 
thus!&rdquo; said pope Julius; and to it again they went, tooth 
and nail, in the most furious manner, till the <!-- page 96--><a 
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>strokes were 
like an earthquake.&nbsp; O you should have seen the three armies
of the damned, tearing one another to pieces over the expanse of 
the burning plains; and each individual body that was rent to 
pieces, becoming joined again serpent fashion.&nbsp; At last 
Lucifer caused his old soldiers, the champions of Hell, to pull 
them from each other, and it was no easy matter to do so.</p>
<p>When the tumult was hushed, pope Clement began to speak.&nbsp;
&ldquo;O emperor of Horrors! as no throne has ever performed more
faithful and universal service to the infernal crown, over a 
great part of the world, for eleven hundred years, than the papal
chair, I hope you will not suffer any one to contend with us for 
your favour.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said a Scott of 
Cromwell&rsquo;s army, &ldquo;though the Koran has done great 
service for eight hundred years, and the superstition of the Pope
for a much longer period, yet has the covenant done more since it
came out, than the other two have ever done.&nbsp; Moreover it is
notorious that, whilst the votaries of those two are every day 
rapidly diminishing, the followers of the covenant are increasing
in numbers, over the whole face of the world, and particularly in
the island of your enemies Britain, whose capital, London, the 
most noble city under the sun, abounds with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Pshaw, pshaw!&rdquo; said Lucifer, &ldquo;if I am rightly 
informed, the covenant itself is under a cloud, and you are no 
longer what you were.&nbsp; And now I have one thing to tell the 
whole of you&mdash;which is, that, whatever ye may do in other 
kingdoms, I will not permit you to trouble mine.&nbsp; Therefore 
rest peaceably, under penalty of worse torments corporeal and 
spiritual.&rdquo;&nbsp; At those words many of the devils dropped
their tails between their hoofs, and all the damned sneaked away 
to their holes, for fear of a change for the worse.</p>
<p><!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
97</span>After causing the whole of them to be locked up in their
prisons, and the careless wardens to be deprived of their office,
for having permitted them to break out, Lucifer and his 
counsellors returned to the palace, and sat down again, according
to their rank, upon their fiery thrones.&nbsp; After silence had 
been called and the place cleared, a huge, wry-shouldered devil, 
placed a back-load of fresh prisoners before the bar.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Is this the road to Paradise,&rdquo; said one, (for they 
all pretended not to know where they were.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Or if 
this be Purgatory,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;we have with us an
authority, under the hand of the Pope, to go straight to Paradise
without tarrying any where a minute.&nbsp; Therefore show us the 
way, or, by the Pope&rsquo;s toe, we will cause him to punish 
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;ho! ho! ho! said eight 
hundred devils; and Lucifer himself, parted his jaws half a yard 
in a kind of bitter laugh.&nbsp; The others were confounded at 
this; but one said, &ldquo;well, if we have lost our way in the 
darkness, we would pay any one who would guide us.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; said Lucifer, &ldquo;you will pay the last 
farthing before ye go.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon each fell to 
searching for his money, but found, to his sorrow, that he had 
left his breeches behind him.&nbsp; Quoth the Arch Fiend, 
&ldquo;you left Paradise on the left hand, above the lofty 
mountains; and, notwithstanding, it was so easy to come down 
here, it is next to impossible to go back, owing to the nature of
the country, through which the road back lies.&nbsp; For it is a 
country abounding with mountains of burning iron, immense dismal 
crags, sheets of eternal ice, and roaring, headlong cataracts; a 
country, in short, far too difficult for you to travel, unless 
indeed you have talons of the true devilish length.&nbsp; Come, 
come,&rdquo; said he to his myrmidons, &ldquo;take these 
blockheads to our paradise, to their companions.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
<!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
98</span>At this moment I could hear the voice of some people who
were coming, swearing and cursing in a frightful manner.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;O the Devil! the blood of the Devil! a hundred thousand 
devils! a thousand million devils take me if I will go 
farther!&rdquo; but, nevertheless, they were cast slap down 
before the judge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here you have,&rdquo; said the 
carrier, &ldquo;a load of as good fire wood as the best in 
Hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; said 
Lucifer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Masters of the genteel art of cursing and 
swearing,&rdquo; replied the devil; &ldquo;men who understand the
language of Hell quite as well as ourselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You lie in your mouth, by the Devil!&rdquo; said one of 
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sirrah! do you take my name in vain?&rdquo; 
said the Arch Fiend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Quick! and hang them by their 
tongues to the burning precipice yonder, and if they call for the
Devil, be ready to serve them; yea, if they call for a thousand, 
let them be satisfied.&rdquo;&nbsp; When these were gone, lo! a 
giant of a devil vociferated to have the bar cleared, and flung 
down a man whom he bore.&nbsp; &ldquo;What have you brought 
there?&rdquo; said Lucifer.&nbsp; &ldquo;A tavern-keeper,&rdquo; 
replied the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;What,&rdquo; said the king, 
&ldquo;<i>one</i> tavern-keeper!&nbsp; Why they are in the habit 
of coming to the tune of five or six thousand.&nbsp; Have you not
been out, sirrah, for ten years, and yet you bring us but one? 
and he one who has done us much more service in the world than 
yourself, you lazy, stinking dog!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are too
ready to condemn me, before listening to me,&rdquo; he 
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;This fellow only was given to my charge, 
and, behold! I am clear of him.&nbsp; But still I have sent to 
you from his house, many a worthless chap, after guzzling down 
the maintenance of his family; many a dicer and card-player; many
a genteel swearer; many a pleasant, good kind of belly god; and 
many a careless servant.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said 
the Arch Fiend, &ldquo;though the tavern-keeper has merited to be
amongst <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>the flatterers below us, take him at 
present to his brethren, in the cell of the liquid murderers; to 
the thousands of apothecaries and poisoners, who are there for 
making drink to kill their customers&mdash;boil him well for not 
having brewed better ale.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;With your 
permission,&rdquo; said the tavern-keeper shivering, &ldquo;I 
have deserved no such treatment.&nbsp; Must not every trade 
live?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And could you not live,&rdquo; said the
Fiend, &ldquo;without encouraging dissipation and gaming, 
uncleanness, drunkenness, oaths, quarrels, slander and lies? and 
would you, hell-hound, live at present better than 
ourselves!&nbsp; Pray what evil have we here that you had not at 
home, the punishment solely excepted?&nbsp; And having told you 
this bitter truth, I will add, that the infernal heat and cold 
were not unknown to you either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not see sparks of our fire in the tongues of 
the swearers and of the scolds, when seeking to get their 
husbands home?&nbsp; Was there not plenty of the unquenchable 
fire in the mouth of the drunkard, and in the eyes of the 
brawler?&nbsp; And could you not perceive something of the 
infernal cold in the lovingness of the spendthrift, and in your 
own civility to your customers, whilst any thing remained with 
them&mdash;in the drollery of the buffoons, in the praise of the 
envious and the backbiter, in the promises of the wanton, or in 
the shanks of the good companions freezing beneath your 
tables?&nbsp; Art thou unacquainted with Hell, when the house 
thou didst keep was Hell?&nbsp; Go, hell-dog, to thy 
punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment appeared ten devils with their burdens, which 
they cast upon the fiery floor, puffing terribly.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What have you there?&rdquo; said Lucifer.&nbsp; &ldquo;We 
have brought,&rdquo; said one of the fiendish carriers, 
&ldquo;five things which were called kings the day before 
yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp; (I looked attentively and <!-- page 
100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
100</span>beheld in one of them old Louis of France.)&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Fling them here,&rdquo; said the king; whereupon they were
flung to the other crowned heads, under the feet of Lucifer.</p>
<p>It was not long before I heard the sound of a brazen trumpet, 
and a crying of room! room! room!&nbsp; After waiting a little 
time, what should be coming but a drove of sessions folk, the 
devils carrying six lumps of justices and a thousand of their 
fry&mdash;consisting of lawyers, attornies, clerks, recorders, 
bailiffs, catchpoles, and pettifoggers of the courts.&nbsp; I was
surprised that none of them attempted to cross-question; but they
perceived that the matter was gone against them too far, and so, 
not one of these learned disputers opened his mouth; only a 
pettifogger of the courts said, that he would lay a plaint of 
false imprisonment against Lucifer.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall now 
have cause enough to complain,&rdquo; said the Fiend, &ldquo;and 
yet never have an opportunity of seeing a court with your 
eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, putting on his red cap, Lucifer, with an
arrogant, insufferable look, said, &ldquo;take the justices to 
the dungeon of Pontius Pilate and Mr. Bradshaw, who condemned 
king Charles.&nbsp; Parch the lawyers in company with the 
murderers of Sir Edmund Bury Godfrey, <a 
name="citation100"></a><a href="#footnote100" 
class="citation">[100]</a> and their double-tongued brethren, who
dispute with one another, for no other purpose than to be the 
ruin of any one who comes betwixt them.&nbsp; Let them greet that
provident lawyer&mdash;for they will find him here&mdash;who 
offered on his death bed a thousand pounds for a clear 
conscience.&nbsp; Let them greet him, and ask, whether he is now 
willing to give any thing more.&nbsp; Roast them with their own 
parchment and papers; hang the pettifoggers above them, with 
their nostrils downwards, in the <!-- page 101--><a 
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>roasting 
chimneys, to receive the smoke, and to see whether they can get 
their belly-full of law.&nbsp; As for the recorders, let them be 
cast among the forestallers, who detain the corn or buy it up and
mix it, and then sell the unsound for double the price of the 
pure corn; just as the former demand double the fees for 
<i>wrong</i>, which were formerly given for <i>right</i>.&nbsp; 
As for the catchpoles, leave them at liberty to hunt vermin; or 
send them to the world, among the dingles and brakes, to seize 
the debtors of the infernal crown&mdash;for what devil among you 
will do the work better than they?&rdquo;&nbsp; At this moment 
twenty devils with packs on their shoulders, like Scotchmen, 
mounted before the throne of Despair, and what had they got, on 
enquiry, but gipsies.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said Lucifer, 
&ldquo;how did ye know the fortunes of others so well, without 
knowing that your own fortune was leading ye to this 
prison.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the gipsies said not a word in reply, 
being confounded at beholding faces here more ugly than their 
own.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hurl them into our deepest dungeon,&rdquo; said
Lucifer, to the fiends, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t starve them; we 
have here neither cats nor rush-lights to give them, but let them
have a toad between them, every ten thousand years, provided they
are quiet, and do not deafen us with their gibberish and 
clibberty clabber.&rdquo;&nbsp; Next to these there came, I 
should imagine, about thirty husbandmen.&nbsp; Every one was 
surprised to see so many of them, people of their honest calling 
seldom coming to Hell; but they were not from the same 
neighbourhood, nor for the same offences.&nbsp; Some were for 
raising the markets; many for refusing to pay tithes, and 
cheating the minister of his rights; others for leaving their 
work, to follow gentry a hunting, and breaking their legs in 
endeavouring to leap with them; some for working on Sundays; some
for carrying their sheep and cattle, in their <!-- page 102--><a 
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>heads to 
church, instead of musing on the Word; others for roguish 
bargains.&nbsp; When Lucifer began to question them, oh! they 
were all as pure as gold; none was aware of having committed any 
thing which deserved such a lot.&nbsp; You will not believe what 
a crafty excuse every one had to conceal his fault, 
notwithstanding he was in Hell on account of it, and this was 
only done out of malice, to thwart Lucifer and to endeavour to 
make the righteous Judge, who had damned them appear 
unjust.&nbsp; But you would have been yet more surprised at the 
dexterity with which the Arch Fiend laid bare their crimes, and 
answered their vain excuses home.&nbsp; But when these were 
receiving the last infernal sentence, there came forty scholars 
before the court, mounted on capering devils, more ugly, if 
possible, than Lucifer himself.&nbsp; And when the scholars heard
the husbandmen arguing, they began to excuse themselves the more 
confidently.&nbsp; But, oh! how ready the old Serpent was at 
answering them too, notwithstanding their craft, and their 
learning.</p>
<p>But as it was my fortune to hear similar disputations at 
another tribunal, I will there give the history of the whole, in 
one mass; and will at present relate to you what I next 
saw.&nbsp; Scarcely had Lucifer uttered judgment upon these 
people, and sent them, for the cool impertinence of their 
reasons, to the vast sheet, in the country of the eternal ice, 
the teeth of the wretches beginning to chatter before they saw 
their prison, when Hell began once more, to resound awfully with 
terrible blows, harsh blustering thunders, and every sound of 
war.&nbsp; I could see Lucifer turn black, and become like a 
statue; at this moment, in rushed a little crooked, horned devil,
panting and shivering.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; 
said Lucifer.&nbsp; &ldquo;The most perilous to you of all 
matters since Hell <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>has been Hell,&rdquo; said the imp; 
&ldquo;all the extremes of the kingdom of Darkness, have broken 
out against you, and against one another; particularly those who 
had any old field in common.&nbsp; They are now at it, tooth and 
nail, so that it is impossible to tear them from each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soldiers are at loggerheads with the physicians, 
for carrying on their trade of slaughter; there is a swarm of 
usurers at loggerheads with the lawyers, for seeking to spoil 
their trade; the jurymen and the duffers are pummelling the 
gentlemen, for swearing and cursing without necessity; whereas, 
swearing and cursing formed part of their trade; the harlots, and
their associates, and millions of other old friends and 
acquaintances, have fallen out, and are all in shatters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But worse than all, is the contest between the old 
misers and their own children, for dissipating their wealth and 
their money.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our property,&rsquo; say the pigtails, 
&lsquo;cost us much pain, whilst we were upon the earth, and is 
causing us immense suffering <i>here</i> for ever, yet ye have 
flung it all away at ducks and drakes.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the 
children, on the other hand, are cursing and tearing the old 
skin-flints, most furiously, charging their fathers with being 
the authors of their misery, by leaving them twenty times <i>too 
much</i>, to distract them with pride and dissipation; whereas, a
<i>little</i>, with a blessing, might have made them happy in 
both their states of existence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; 
said Lucifer, &ldquo;enough! enough! we have more need of arms 
than words.&nbsp; Sirrah, this hubbub is owing to some great 
neglect; go back, and pry into every watch, and discover who has 
been neglectful; and what dangerous characters have been 
permitted to escape, for there are some evils abroad, that are 
not known.&rdquo;&nbsp; Away <!-- page 104--><a 
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>he went, at
the word, and in the meanwhile, Lucifer and his potentates arose 
in terror, and exceeding consternation, and caused the boldest 
bands of the black angels to be assembled.&nbsp; When these were 
marshalled, he put himself at the head of his own peculiar band, 
and marched forth to quell the insurrection, whilst the 
potentates went other ways with their legions.</p>
<p>Before the royal troop had gone any great distance, gleaming 
like the lightning of the black abodes, (and we behind them,) 
behold the hubbub advanced to meet them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Silence, in
the name of the king,&rdquo; said a fiendish herald.&nbsp; There 
was no hearing; it was easier to tear the old crocodile from his 
prey than one of these.</p>
<p>But when the old tried soldiers of Lucifer broke into the 
midst of them, the buzzing, the butting, and the blows began to 
slacken.&nbsp; &ldquo;Silence, in the name of Lucifer,&rdquo; 
said the hoarse cryer again.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the 
matter?&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;and who are 
these?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is nothing particularly the 
matter,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;but the drovers, happening 
in the general commotion to come in contact with the cuckolds, 
they went mutually to butting, to try whose horns were hardest; 
and this butting might have gone on for ever, if your horned 
champions had not interfered.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; 
said Lucifer, &ldquo;since you are all so ready with your arms, 
turn along with me to quell other rioters.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when 
it was buzzed about among the other rebels, that Lucifer was 
coming with three horned legions against them, each slunk away to
his lair.</p>
<p>Thus Lucifer advanced without opposition, along the 
wildernesses of Destruction, endeavouring to ascertain what was 
the commencement of the disturbance, but could obtain no 
information.&nbsp; After a little time, however, one of the spies
<!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
105</span>of the king returned, quite out of breath.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;O most noble Lucifer!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;prince Moloch
has quieted part of the North and has scattered thousands over 
the sheets of ice; but three or four terrible evils are still out
on the wind.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; said 
Lucifer.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Slanderer</i>, and <i>Meddler</i>, and 
<i>Litigious Pettifogger</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have broken 
their prisons and are at liberty.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then it 
would be no wonder,&rdquo; said the Arch Fiend, &ldquo;if there 
should be yet more disturbance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment there came another, who had been on the 
look-out towards the South, with the information that the evil 
had begun to break out there; but that three had been taken, who 
had previously turned every thing topsy-turvy in the West, and 
these three were <i>Madam Bouncer</i>, <i>Contriver</i>, and<i> 
Coxcomb</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Satan, who was 
standing next but one to Lucifer, &ldquo;since I tempted Adam 
from his garden, I have never yet seen from his seed, so many 
evils out upon one piece of business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bouncer, Coxcomb, and Contriver on the one side,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;and on the other Slanderer, Pettifogger, and 
Meddler are a compound, enough to make a thousand devils sweat 
their bowels out.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is no wonder,&rdquo; 
said Lucifer, &ldquo;that they are so detested by every body on 
earth, when they are able to cause us so much trouble 
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; A little farther on, a great bouncing lady 
struck against the king, as she was moving backwards.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Ho! my aunt of the breeches,&rdquo; said a hoarse devil, 
&ldquo;good night to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, your aunt, 
indeed! on what side pray?&rdquo; said she, very wrathful, 
because she was not called madam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty king are you, sir Lucifer,&rdquo; said she, 
&ldquo;to keep such unmannerly blockheads; it is a sin that so 
large a kingdom should be under one so incompetent to govern 
them.&nbsp; <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>O that I were made deputy over 
it!&rdquo;&nbsp; At this moment behold the <i>Coxcomb</i>, 
nodding his head in the dark, &ldquo;Your servant, sir,&rdquo; he
would say to one over his shoulder.&mdash;&ldquo;I hope you are 
quite well,&rdquo; said he to another.&mdash;&ldquo;Is there any 
service which I can render you,&rdquo; to a third, smiling 
conceitedly.&mdash;&ldquo;Your beauty ravishes my heart,&rdquo; 
said he to the bouncing wench.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! oh! away with 
this hell-dog,&rdquo; said she; whilst every one cried, 
&ldquo;away with this new tormentor!&nbsp; Hell upon Hell is 
he!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bind him and her head to tail,&rdquo; 
said Lucifer.</p>
<p>After a little time, behold <i>Courts Comprised</i> held 
betwixt two devils.&nbsp; &ldquo;O ho! angel of patience,&rdquo; 
said Lucifer, &ldquo;are you come?&nbsp; Hold him fast on your 
peril,&rdquo; said he to the satellites.&nbsp; Before we had 
advanced far, there came the <i>Contriver</i> and the 
<i>Slanderer</i> bound betwixt forty devils, and whispering in 
each others ears.&nbsp; &ldquo;O most mighty Lucifer!&rdquo; said
the <i>Contriver</i>, &ldquo;I am exceedingly grieved to see so 
much disturbance in your dominions, but I will teach you a way to
prevent such in future, if you will but grant me a hearing.&nbsp;
You only need, under pretence of a general parliament, to summon 
all the damned to the glowing pandemonium, and then cause the 
devils to cast them headlong into the throat of <i>Unknown</i>, 
and the gulf to be closed over them, and then, I warrant you, 
they will give you no more trouble.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Lucifer, frowning very horribly on the 
<i>Contriver</i>, &ldquo;the universal Meddler is still 
behind.&rdquo;&nbsp; On returning again to the porch of the 
infernal palace, who should come with the fairest face imaginable
to meet the king but the <i>Meddler</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;O my 
liege,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have a word for you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps I have one or two for you,&rdquo; said the 
Fiend.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been,&rdquo; continued the Meddler, 
&ldquo;over half <i>Destruction</i>, to observe how your affairs 
are standing.&nbsp; You have many officers in the East doing <!--
page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
107</span>nothing at all; but sitting still instead of looking to
the torments of their prisoners, or keeping guard over them, and 
this has been the cause of all this great disturbance.&nbsp; 
Besides,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;many of your devils, and your 
damned too, whom you dispatched to the world to tempt folks, are 
not returned, though their time is out; and others have arrived 
in a sculking manner, and not given an account of their 
errands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Lucifer caused the herald to proclaim another parliament;
and lo! before you could turn your hand, all the potentates and 
satellites were met together, to hold the infernal sessions 
again.&nbsp; The first thing which was done was to change the 
officers, and to cause a place to be made about the throat of 
Unknown, for the reception of the Coxcomb, the bouncing lady, and
the rest; the two first were tied nose to nose, and the other 
rioters tail to tail.&nbsp; Then a law was promulgated, that 
whoever should henceforth neglect his duty, whether imp or lost 
man, should be cast there among them until the day of 
judgment.&nbsp; At these words you might see all the 
goblins&mdash;yea, Lucifer himself&mdash;tremble and look 
agitated.&nbsp; The next thing was to call some devils and some 
damned to reckoning, who had been sent to the world to hunt up 
recruits: the devils gave a very good account of themselves; but 
some of the damned were lame in their reckoning, and were sent to
the hot school, where they were scourged with twisted fiery 
serpents, for not learning their lesson better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear my complaint,&rdquo; said a little informing 
devil.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is a pretty woman when trimmed out, who 
was sent up to the world, to hunt subjects for you by means of 
their hearts; and to whom did she offer herself, but to a 
hard-working labourer coming home late from his occupation, who 
<!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
108</span>instead of enjoying himself with her, went upon his 
knees to pray against the Devil and his angels: at another time, 
she went to a sick man.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said 
Lucifer, &ldquo;cast her to that lost useless wench, who loved of
yore Einion ab Gwalehmai, <a name="citation108"></a><a 
href="#footnote108" class="citation">[108]</a> of 
Anglesey.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said the fair one, 
&ldquo;this is but the first offence.&nbsp; It is not yet above a
year, since the day when I breathed my last, and was damned to 
your accursed government.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She speaks true, O 
king of Torments!&nbsp; It is not yet a year by three 
weeks,&rdquo; said the devil who had brought her there.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;how would you have me 
so well versed as the damned, who have been here for three 
hundred, or out abroad depredating for five hundred years.&nbsp; 
If you desire from me better service, let me go into the world 
another time or two unchastised; and if I do not bring you twenty
harlot-mongers, for every year that I am out, inflict upon me 
whatever punishment you please.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the verdict went
against her, and she was condemned to punishment for a hundred 
long years, that she might remember better the second time.</p>
<p>At this moment, behold another devil pushing a fellow 
forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here you have,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a 
pretty dog of a messenger.&nbsp; As he was prowling about his old
neighbourhood, above stairs, the other night, he saw a thief 
going to steal a stallion, and could not so much as help him to 
catch the horse without showing himself, frightening the thief so
by his horrible appearance, that he took warning and became an 
honest man from that time.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;With the 
permission of the court,&rdquo; said the fellow, &ldquo;if the 
thief had got the gift from <!-- page 109--><a 
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
109</span><i>above</i> to see me, could I help it?&nbsp; But at 
worst this is a single peccadillo,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it is 
not above a hundred years since the day which terminated my 
mortal career, yet how many of my friends and neighbours have I 
not tempted hither after me, during that time?&nbsp; May I be in 
the deepest pit, if I have not as much inclination for the trade 
as the best of you; but now and then the craftiest will 
err.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Lucifer, &ldquo;cast 
him to the school of the fairies, who are yet under the rod for 
their mischievous conduct of old, in strangling some people and 
threatening others; startling by such behaviour their neighbours 
from their heedlessness, upon whom the terror which they caused, 
had probably more effect than twenty sermons would have 
had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next appeared four catchpoles, an informer, and fifteen 
damned, hauling two <i>devils</i> forward.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said the informer, &ldquo;lest you should lay 
the blame of all that is mismanaged on the seed of Adam, we bring
you two of your old angels, who have spent their time above, 
quite as badly as the two preceding.&nbsp; Here is a fellow who 
has been making as great a fool of himself, as the Devil did at 
Shrewsbury the other day; who, in the midst of the interlude of 
Doctor Faustus, whilst some, according to the custom on such 
occasions, were committing adultery with their eyes, some with 
their hands, others making assignations for the same purpose, and
doing various other things profitable to your kingdom, made his 
appearance to play his own part; by which blunder, he drove every
one from taking his pleasure to praying.&nbsp; In like manner did
this numskull act; for, whilst journeying over the world, on 
hearing two wenches talking of walking round the church at night,
in order to see their sweethearts, he must needs show himself in 
the figure he wears at home, to the <!-- page 110--><a 
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>two fools, 
who on recovering their senses, which at first they lost from 
fright, solemnly abjured all frivolity for ever.&nbsp; 
There&rsquo;s a ninny-hammer for you!&nbsp; Instead of appearing 
like a devil, he ought to have divided himself and assumed the 
forms of two dirty, unlicked boors; for the girls would have 
imagined themselves bound to accept them, and then the filthy 
goblin might have lived as husband with the two female parties, 
without troubling a clergyman to perform the marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here is another,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;who went 
the last dark night, to visit two young maidens in Wales, who 
were <i>turning the shift</i>; and instead of enticing the girls 
to wantonness in the figure of a handsome youth, he must needs go
to one with a <i>hearse</i> to sober her; and to the other with 
the <i>sound of war</i> in an infernal whirlwind, to drive her 
farther from her senses than she was before, and there was no 
need for that.&nbsp; But this is not the whole, for after going 
into the last girl, he cast her down and tormented her furiously,
so that her parents in horror, sent for some of our enemies the 
clergy, to pray over her and cast him out, which they did.&nbsp; 
Now, if he had been wise, instead of kicking up such a hubbub, he
would have tempted her quietly to despair, and to make away with 
herself.&nbsp; On another time, wishing to gain some of the 
conventiclers, he went to preach to them, and revealed the 
secrets of your kingdom; thus, instead of hindering, assisting 
their salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the word <i>salvation</i>, I 
could see some emitting living fire for madness.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Capital stories both, I won&rsquo;t deny,&rdquo; said the 
goblin; &ldquo;but I hope that Lucifer will not permit one of 
Adam&rsquo;s race of dirt, to put himself on an equality with me 
who am an angel, of a species and descent far 
superior.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Lucifer, &ldquo;he 
may be <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>sure of his punishment.&nbsp; But, 
sirrah, answer to these accusations speedily and clearly, or by 
hopeless Destruction I will&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have 
brought hither,&rdquo; said the goblin, &ldquo;many a soul since 
Satan was in the garden of Eden, and ought to know my trade 
better than this novice of an informer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Blood
of an infernal fire-brand!&rdquo; said Lucifer, &ldquo;did I not 
command you to answer speedily and clearly.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Do but hear me,&rdquo; said the sprite.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to
preaching, by your own command I have been a hundred times 
<i>preaching</i>, and have forbidden people to follow several of 
the roads which lead to your territories, and yet silently, in 
the same breath, have led them hither safe enough, by some other 
vain paths; as I have done by preaching lately in Germany, and in
one of the Faroe isles, and various other places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus through my preaching,&rdquo; he continued, 
&ldquo;have come many of the <i>superstitions</i> of the papists,
and the <i>old fables</i> first to the world, and the whole under
the shape of some goodness.&nbsp; For who ever swallows the hook 
without some bait? who ever would believe a story if there were 
not some measure of <i>truth</i> mingled with the falsehood; or 
some semblance of <i>good</i> to shade the <i>evil</i>?&nbsp; 
Thus if I find an opportunity in preaching, to push in amongst a 
hundred correct and salutary counsels, one of my own, with this 
one I will do you, either through <i>contentiousness</i> or 
<i>superstition</i>, more advantage than all the rest of my 
counsels will do you harm.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said 
Lucifer, &ldquo;since you are of such utility in your pulpit, I 
order you for seven years, to take up your abode in the mouth of 
one of the barn-preachers, who will be sure to utter the first 
thing which comes to his tongue&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; Then you will 
find an opportunity to put in a word now and then, to your own 
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>There were still many more devils and damned who were 
twisting through one another like lightning, around the throne of
Terrors, to give an account of what they had done, and again to 
receive commissions.&nbsp; But suddenly and unexpectedly, an 
order was given to all the messengers and the prisoners, to go 
out of the palace, every one to his hole, and to leave the king 
and his chief counsellors there alone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had we not 
best depart,&rdquo; said I to my companion, &ldquo;lest they 
should find us?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You need not fear,&rdquo; 
said the angel &ldquo;no unclean spirit will ever see through 
this veil.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus we continued there invisible, to see
what was the matter.&nbsp; Then Lucifer began to speak graciously
to his counsellors, in this manner:&mdash;&ldquo;O ye, the chief 
spiritual evils!&mdash;ye, who for subtlety are unequalled in 
Unknown, I request you in my need, to exert to the uttermost your
malicious wiles.&nbsp; No one here is unaware, that Britain and 
the surrounding isles, constitute the kingdom most dangerous to 
my authority, and most abounding with my enemies; and what is a 
hundred times worse, there is at present there a queen, who does 
not offer to turn once hitherward, either by the road of Rome on 
the one hand, or the road of Geneva on the other.&nbsp; 
Notwithstanding, all the service which the Pope has rendered us 
there for a long time, and Oliver for some years past, how far 
are we from our object? what shall we do now?&nbsp; I am afraid 
that we shall lose there our ancient possession, and our market 
entirely, if we do not pave immediately some new way for its 
inhabitants to walk in, for they know all the old roads which 
lead hither too well.&nbsp; And, since yonder invincible fist 
shortens my chain, and prevents me from going myself to the 
earth, counsel me, I pray you, as to whom I shall make my deputy,
to oppose yonder detestable queen, <!-- page 113--><a 
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>who is the 
deputy of our enemy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O mighty emperor of 
Darkness!&rdquo; said Cerberus, the devil of Tobacco, &ldquo;make
a deputy of me, from whom the crown of Britain derives the third 
part of its revenue.&nbsp; I will go and will send to you a 
hundred thousand of the souls of your enemies, through the hollow
of a pipe.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Lucifer, 
&ldquo;you have done me excellent service, by causing the 
proprietors of tobacco in India to be slaughtered, and those who 
take it to die of diseases, and sending many to vend it idly from
house to house, and making others to steal in order to obtain it,
and thousands to love it so far, that they cannot be a day 
without it in their right senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore go and do thy best; but, I tell thee, that 
thou art little better than nothing in the present 
exigency.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon Cerberus sat down, and uprose 
Mammon, devil of Money, and with a morose sinister look 
said:&mdash;&ldquo;I showed men the first mine from which they 
got money, and therefore, I am always extolled and worshipped 
more than God; men undergo for me trouble and danger, and place 
their whole mind, their delight, and their trust upon me: there 
is no one easy, because he has not obtained somewhat more of my 
favour, and the more they obtain the farther are they ever from 
rest, until at length by seeking <i>easy circumstances</i>, they 
arrive at the country of Eternal Torments.&nbsp; How many a 
crafty old miser have I not deluded hither, along paths more 
difficult than those which lead to the kingdom of 
Happiness?&nbsp; At fair or market, sessions or elections, or any
other assemblage of people, who has more subjects? who has more 
power and authority than I?&nbsp; Cursing, swearing, fighting, 
litigating, plotting, deceiving, striking, hoarding, murdering 
and robbing, sabbath breaking and uncharitableness, all proceed 
from me: <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>and there is no other black mark, 
which stamps men as belonging to the fold of Lucifer, which I 
have not a hand in giving, on which account I am called 
&lsquo;the root of all evil.&rsquo;&nbsp; Therefore if it seem 
good to your majesty, I will go.&rdquo;&nbsp; And having said 
that he sat down.</p>
<p>Then arose Apollyon.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said 
he, &ldquo;any thing that will bring the Britons hither, more 
certainly than what brought yourselves&mdash;that is 
<i>Pride</i>: if she ever plant her pole within them and inflate 
them, there is no reason to fear that they will stoop to lift the
cross, or go through the narrow gate.&nbsp; I will go,&rdquo; 
said he, &ldquo;with my daughter Pride, and will cause the Welsh,
by gazing on the magnificence of the English, and the English, by
imitating the frivolities of the French, to tumble into this 
place before they know where they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next arose Asmodeus, devil of Wantonness.&nbsp; &ldquo;You 
cannot but be aware,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;O most mighty 
sovereign of the Abyss! and you, ye princes of the country of 
Despair! how I have crammed the nooks of Hell through debauchery 
and lasciviousness.&nbsp; What need have I to speak of the time, 
when I kindled such a flame of lust in the whole world, that it 
was necessary to send the flood, to clear the earth of its 
inhabitants, and to sweep them to us in the unquenchable fire; or
of Sodom and Gomorrah, fair and pleasant cities, whose people I 
burnt with wantonness, till their infernal lusts brought down a 
fiery shower, which drove them hither alive to burn to all 
eternity; or of the vast army of the Assyrians, which was slain 
all in one night on account of me?&nbsp; Sarah I disappointed of 
seven husbands; Solomon, the wisest of men, and many thousand 
other kings I blinded by means of women.&nbsp; Therefore,&rdquo; 
said he, &ldquo;suffer me to go with my <!-- page 115--><a 
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span><i>sweet 
sin</i>, and I will kindle in Britain the sparks of Hell so 
universally, that it shall become one with this place of 
unextinguishable flame; for there is not much chance, that any 
one will return from following me, to lay hold of the paths of 
Life.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon he sat down.</p>
<p>Then arose Belphegor, prince of <i>Sloth and 
Idleness</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the great
prince of Listlessness and Laziness; great is my power on myriads
of men of all ages and degrees.&nbsp; I am the still pool, where 
&lsquo;the root of all evil&rsquo; is generated; where coagulate 
the dregs of all destructive corruption and filthiness.&nbsp; 
What would you be worth, Asmodeus; or you, ye other master 
spirits of evil, without me who keep the window open for you, 
without any watch, so that you may go into man by his eyes, by 
his ears, by his mouth, and by every other orifice which he has, 
whensoever you please.&nbsp; I will go, and will roll to you all 
the inhabitants of Britain over the precipice in their 
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then arose Satan, the devil of <i>Deceit</i>, who sat next to 
Lucifer on his left hand, and after turning a frightful visage on
the king,&mdash;&ldquo;It is unnecessary for me,&rdquo; he said, 
&ldquo;to declare my deeds to you, O lost archangel! or to you, 
black princes of Destruction! because it was I who struck the 
first blow which man ever received; and a mighty blow it was, 
causing him to remain <i>mortal</i>, from the beginning of the 
world to its end.&nbsp; Do you imagine that I, who despoiled the 
whole world, cannot at present give counsel which will serve for 
a paltry islet?&nbsp; And cannot I, who cheated <i>Eve</i> in 
<i>Paradise</i>, vanquish <i>Anne</i> in <i>Britain</i>?&nbsp; If
no natural craft will avail, and continued experience for more 
than five thousand years, my counsel to you is, to dress up your 
daughter <i>Hypocrisy</i>, to deceive Britain and its queen; you 
have not a daughter in <!-- page 116--><a 
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>the world, 
so useful to you as she; she has more extensive authority and 
more numerous subjects, than all your other daughters.&nbsp; Was 
it not through <i>her</i> that I cheated the first woman?&nbsp; 
It was: and ever from that time she has remained and increased 
exceedingly upon the earth.&nbsp; At present indeed, the whole 
vast world is but one <i>Hypocrisy</i>; and if it were not for 
the skill of Hypocrisy, how should any one of us do business in 
any corner of the world?&nbsp; Because if people were to see 
<i>sin</i> in its own <i>color</i>, and under its own 
<i>name</i>, who would ever come in contact with it?&nbsp; The 
world would no more do so, than it would embrace the Devil in his
infernal shape and garb.&nbsp; If Hypocrisy were not able to 
disguise her <i>name</i>, and the <i>nature</i> of every 
<i>evil</i>, under the similitude of some <i>good</i>, and were 
not able to give some evil nickname to all <i>goodness</i>, no 
one would approach, and no one would covet evil at all.&nbsp; 
Traverse the whole city of Destruction, and you will see her in 
every corner.&nbsp; Go to the street of <i>Pride</i>, and enquire
for an <i>arrogant man</i>, or for a pennyworth of 
<i>coquetry</i>, mixed up by Pride; &lsquo;woe&rsquo;s me,&rsquo;
says Hypocrisy, &lsquo;there is no such thing here; nothing at 
all I assure you in the whole street but grandeur.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Or go to the street of <i>Lucre</i>, and enquire for the house of
the <i>Miser</i>; fie, there is no such person in it: or for the 
house of the <i>murderer</i> amongst the physicians: or the house
of the <i>arrant thief</i> amongst the drovers, and see how you 
would fare; you would sooner get into prison for enquiring, than 
get any body to confess his name.&nbsp; Yes, Hypocrisy creeps 
between man and his own heart, and conceals every <i>iniquity</i>
so craftily, under the name and similitude of some virtue, that 
she has made every body almost unable to recognise himself.&nbsp;
<i>Avarice</i> she will call <i>economy</i>.&nbsp; In her 
language <i>dissipation</i> is <i>innocent diversion</i>; 
<i>pride</i> is <i>gentility</i>; a <i>perverse</i> <!-- page 
117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
117</span><i>man </i>is a <i>fine manly fellow</i>; 
<i>drunkenness</i> is <i>good fellowship</i>, and <i>adultery</i>
is only the <i>heat of youth</i>.&nbsp; On the other hand, if 
<i>she</i> and her disciples are to be believed, the <i>devout 
man</i> is only a <i>hypocrite</i> or a <i>blockhead</i>; the 
<i>gentle</i> but a <i>sneaking dog</i>; the <i>sober</i> a mere 
<i>hunks</i>, and so on.&nbsp; Send her, therefore,&rdquo; he 
continued, &ldquo;thither, in her full array, I will warrant that
she will deceive every body, and that she will blind the 
counsellors and the warriors, and all the officers, secular and 
ecclesiastical, and will draw them hither in multitudes 
presently, by means of her <i>mask of changeable 
hue</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon he sat down.</p>
<p>Then Beelzebub arose, the devil of <i>Inconsiderateness</i>, 
and with a rough, bellowing voice,&mdash;&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;the mighty prince of <i>Bewilderment</i>; to me it 
pertains to prevent man from reflecting upon and considering his 
condition.&nbsp; I am the principal of those wicked, infernal 
<i>flies</i> which craze mankind, by keeping them ever in a kind 
of continual buzz, about their possessions or their pleasures, 
without ever leaving them with my consent, a moment&rsquo;s 
respite, to think about their courses or their end.&nbsp; It ill 
becomes one of you, to attempt to put himself on an equality with
me, for feats useful to the kingdom of Darkness.&nbsp; For what 
is Tobacco but one of my meanest instruments, to carry 
bewilderment into the brain?&nbsp; And what is the kingdom of 
<i>Mammon</i>, but a branch of my vast domain?&nbsp; Yea, if I 
were to recite the ties which I have on the subjects of 
<i>Mammon</i> and <i>Pride</i>&mdash;yea, and on the subjects of 
<i>Asmodeus</i>, <i>Belphegor</i>, and <i>Hypocrisy</i>&mdash;no 
man would tarry a minute longer under the rule of one of 
them.&nbsp; Therefore,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am the one to do 
the work, and let none of you boast again about his 
merits.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Lucifer the Great arose himself from 
his burning throne, and with a would-be complaisant but 
nevertheless frightful look on both <!-- page 118--><a 
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
118</span>sides,&mdash;&ldquo;Ye master-spirits of eternal Night!
ye supreme possessors of the cunning of Despair!&rdquo; he said, 
&ldquo;though the vast black gulf and the wilds of Destruction, 
are indebted to no one for inhabitants, more than to my own royal
majesty since I of yore, failing to drag the Omnipotent from his 
possession, drew millions of you, my swarthy angels to this place
of horrors, and have since drawn millions of men to you; 
nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that ye too have all done your
part, to sustain this vast infernal empire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Lucifer began to answer them one by one.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
one of late origin, I will not deny, O <i>Cerberus</i>, that thou
hast brought to us many a booty from the island of our enemies, 
by means of tobacco, a weed the cause of much deceit; for how 
much deceit is practiced in carrying it about, in mixing it, and 
in weighing it: a weed which entices some people to bib ale; 
others to curse, swear, and to flatter in order to obtain it, and
others to tell lies in denying that they use it: a weed 
productive of maladies in various bodies, the excess of which is 
injurious to every man&rsquo;s body, without speaking of his 
<i>soul</i>: a weed, moreover, by which we get multitudes of the 
poor, whom we should never get, did they not set their love on 
tobacco, and allow it to master them, and pull the bread from the
mouths of their children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for you, my brother <i>Mammon</i>, your power is
so universal, and likewise so manifest upon the earth, that it 
has become a proverb that &lsquo;<i>any thing can be got for 
money</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; And undoubtedly,&rdquo; said he, turning 
to Apollyon, &ldquo;my beloved daughter <i>Pride</i> is of great 
utility to us; for what is more capable of injuring a man in his 
condition, his body, and his soul, than that <i>proud</i>, 
<i>haughty idea</i>, which will make him squander a <i>hundred 
pounds</i> for display, rather than stoop to <!-- page 119--><a 
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>give a 
<i>crown</i> for peace.&nbsp; <i>She</i> keeps people so 
stiff-necked, with their sight so intent on lofty things, that it
is a pleasure to see them, by staring and reaching into the air, 
falling plump into the abysses of Hell.&nbsp; As for you, 
<i>Asmodeus</i>, we all remember your great services of yore; no 
one keeps his prisoners more firmly under the lock, and no one 
meets with less rebuke than yourself&mdash;the whole rebuke, 
indeed, consisting in a little laughing, at what is called wanton
tricks.&nbsp; Yes, Asmodeus, I admit that your power is very 
great; though I cannot help reminding you,&rdquo; he added, with 
a jocular though truly infernal grin, &ldquo;that you were all 
but starved, above there, during the last dear years.&nbsp; As 
for you, my son <i>Belphegor</i>, lousy prince of Sloth, nobody 
has afforded us more pleasure than yourself, so very great is 
your authority amongst gentle and simple, even down to the 
beggar.&nbsp; Nevertheless, if it were not for the skill of my 
daughter <i>Hypocrisy</i>, in coloring and disguising, who would 
ever swallow one of your hooks?&nbsp; And after all, if it were 
not for the diligent firmness of my brother <i>Beelzebub</i>, in 
keeping men in <i>inconsiderate bewilderment</i>, I question 
whether all of you united would be worth a straw.&nbsp; 
Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us review the whole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you be worth, Cerberus, with your excessive 
sucking, if it were not for the assistance of Mammon?&nbsp; What 
merchant would ever fetch your leaves from India, through so many
perils, if it were not for the sake of Mammon?&nbsp; And if it 
were not for <i>his</i> sake, what king would receive it, in 
Britain especially?&nbsp; And who, but for the sake of Mammon, 
would carry it to every corner of the kingdom?&nbsp; But, 
notwithstanding this, what wouldst thou be worth, Mammon, without
Pride to squander thee upon fine houses, magnificent garments, 
needless litigations, music, horses and <!-- page 120--><a 
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>costly 
appurtenances, various dishes, beer and ale in a flood, far above
the <i>means</i> and <i>rank</i> of the possessor; for if money 
were used within the limits of <i>necessity</i> and 
<i>propriety</i>, of what advantage would Mammon be to us?&nbsp; 
Thus you would be worth nothing without <i>Pride</i>; and little 
would <i>Pride</i> be worth without <i>Wantonness</i>, because 
bastards are the most numerous and the fiercest subjects, which 
my daughter <i>Pride</i> possesses in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You too, Asmodeus, prince of <i>Wantonness</i>, what 
would you be worth, if it were not for <i>Sloth and Idleness</i>;
where but for them would you get a night&rsquo;s lodging?&nbsp; 
You could hardly expect it from a labourer or toiling 
student.&nbsp; And you, Belphegor of Idleness, who would welcome 
you a minute, attended as you would be with shame and reproach, 
if it were not for Hypocrisy, who conceals your ugliness under 
the name of <i>internal sickness</i>, or of a <i>well meaning 
person</i>, or under the shape of <i>despising riches</i> and the
like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she too, my dear daughter <i>Hypocrisy</i>, what is
she worth, or what would she ever be worth, skilful and resolute 
sempstress as she is, if it were not for your help, my eldest 
brother <i>Beelzebub</i>, mighty prince of 
<i>Inconsiderateness</i>.&nbsp; If he would leave people leisure 
and respite, to seriously consider the nature of things and their
difference, how often would they spy holes in the folds of the 
gold-cloth robe of <i>Hypocrisy</i>, and perceive the hooks 
through the bait?&nbsp; What man, did not Inconsiderateness 
deprive him of his senses, would chase baubles and 
pleasures&mdash;evanescent, surfeiting, foolish and 
disgraceful&mdash;and prefer them to <i>peace of conscience</i>, 
and glorious <i>everlasting happiness</i>?&nbsp; And who would 
hesitate to suffer martyrdom for his faith, for an hour or a day,
or to endure affliction for forty or sixty years, if he would 
reflect that his <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>neighbours here are suffering in an 
hour, more than he can ever suffer upon the earth?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tobacco</i> then is nothing without <i>money</i>, 
nor money without <i>Pride</i>; and Pride is but feeble without 
Wantonness, and Wantonness is nothing without <i>Idleness</i>; 
Idleness without <i>Hypocrisy</i>, and Hypocrisy without 
<i>Inconsiderateness</i>.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; said Lucifer, (and he
raised his fiendish hoofs on the fore claws,) &ldquo;to speak my 
own opinion, however excellent all these may be, I have a 
<i>friend</i> to send against the she-enemy of Britain, better 
than the whole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I could see all the chief devils, with their ghastly 
mouths opened towards Lucifer, in anxious expectation of learning
what this friend might be, whilst I was as impatient to hear as 
they.&nbsp; &ldquo;The one I allude to,&rdquo; said Lucifer, 
&ldquo;is called <i>Ease</i>; she is one whose merits I have too 
long disregarded, and whose merit, Satan, you yourself 
disregarded of yore, when in tempting Job you turned the 
unpleasant side of life towards him.&nbsp; She is my darling, and
her I now constitute deputy, immediately next to myself, in all 
matters relating to my earthly government; Ease is her name, and 
<i>she</i> has damned more men than all ye together, and very few
would ye catch without <i>her</i>.&nbsp; For in <i>war</i>, <i>or
danger</i>, <i>or hunger</i>, <i>or sickness</i>, who would value
<i>tobacco</i>, <i>or money</i>, or the pomposity of Pride, or 
would entertain a thought of welcoming either <i>Wantonness or 
Sloth</i>?&nbsp; Or who in such straits, would permit themselves 
to be distracted either by <i>Hypocrisy or 
Inconsiderateness</i>?&nbsp; No, no! they are too awake then, and
not one of the infernal <i>flies of Bewilderment</i>, which shows
its beak, will buzz, during one of these storms.&nbsp; But 
<i>Ease</i>, smooth Ease, is the nurse of you all: in her calm 
shadow, and in her teeming bosom ye are all bred, and also every 
other infernal <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>worm of the conscience, which will 
come to gnaw its possessor <i>here</i> for ever, without 
intermission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as <i>Ease</i> lasts, there is no talk but of 
some species of diversion, of banquets, bargains, pedigrees, 
stories, news, and the like.&nbsp; There is no mention of 
<i>God</i>, except in idle swearing and cursing; whereas the 
<i>poor</i> and the <i>sick</i>, who know nothing of ease, have 
God in their mouths and their hearts every minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But go ye also in the rear of her, and keep every body 
in his sleep and his rest, in prosperity and comfort, abundance 
and carelessness; and then you will see the poor honest man, as 
soon as he shall drink of the alluring cup of Ease, become a 
perverse, proud, untractable churl&mdash;the industrious labourer
change into a careless, waggish rattler&mdash;and every other 
person become just what you would desire him.&nbsp; Because 
pleasant <i>Ease</i> is what every one seeks and loves; she hears
not counsel, fears not punishment&mdash;if good, she will not 
recognise it&mdash;if bad, she will foster it of her own 
accord.&nbsp; <i>She</i> is the prime-temptation; the man who is 
proof against <i>her</i> tender charms, ye may fling your caps 
to&mdash;for we must bid farewell for ever to his company.&nbsp; 
<i>Ease</i>, then, is my terrestrial <i>deputy</i>, follow her to
Britain, and be as obedient to her as to our own royal 
majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the huge bolt was shaken, and Lucifer and his 
chief counsellors were struck to the vortex of <i>extremest 
Hell</i>; and oh, how horrible it was to see the throat of 
Unknown opening to receive them!&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said 
the angel &ldquo;we will now return; but you have not yet seen 
any thing in comparison with the <i>whole</i>, which is within 
the bounds of <i>Destruction</i>, and if you had seen the whole, 
it is nothing to the inexpressible misery which exists in 
<i>Unknown</i>, for it is <!-- page 123--><a 
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>not 
possible to form an idea of the World in extremest 
Hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; And at that word the celestial messenger 
snatched me up to the firmament of the accursed kingdom of 
Darkness, by a way I had not seen, whence I obtained, from the 
palace along all the firmament of the black and hot 
<i>Destruction</i>, and the whole <i>land of Forgetfulness</i>, 
even to the walls of the <i>city of Destruction</i>, a full view 
of the accursed monster of a <i>giantess</i>, whose feet I had 
seen before&mdash;I do not possess words to describe her 
figure.&nbsp; But I can tell you that she was a <i>triple-faced 
giantess</i>, having one very atrocious countenance turned 
towards the heavens, barking, snorting and vomiting accursed 
abomination against the celestial king; another countenance very 
fair towards the <i>earth</i>, to entice men to tarry in her 
shadow; and another, the most frightful countenance of all, 
turned towards <i>Hell</i>, to torment it to all eternity.&nbsp; 
She is larger than the entire earth, and is yet daily increasing,
and a hundred times more frightful than the whole of Hell.&nbsp; 
She caused Hell to be made, and it is she who fills it with 
inhabitants.&nbsp; If <i>she</i> were removed from Hell, Hell 
would become Paradise; and if she were removed from the earth, 
the little world would become Heaven; and if she were to go to 
Heaven, she would change the regions of bliss into utter 
Hell.&nbsp; There is nothing in all the universe, (except 
herself,) that God did not create.&nbsp; She is the mother of the
four female deceivers of the city of Destruction; she is the 
mother of <i>Death</i>; she is the mother of every <i>evil</i> 
and <i>misery</i>; and she has a fearful hold on every living 
man&mdash;her name is SIN.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>He who escapes from 
her hook</i>, <i>for ever blessed is he</i>!&rdquo; said the 
angel.&nbsp; Thereupon he departed, and I could hear his voice 
saying, &ldquo;<i>write down what thou hast seen</i>, <i>and he 
who shall read it carefully shall never have reason to 
repent</i>.&rdquo;</p>

Seeing that the end of the crooked track<br />

Where sin has the meed it has merited;<br />
What frightful taunts from forked tongue,<br />

The ghastliness of the damned things to state.<br />

At losing one&rsquo;s fame, or alas! one&rsquo;s health;<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
